* Congenital Hyperinsulinemia
** Insulin Secretion
- glucose is transported into the pancreatic \beta-cell and phosphorylated to G-6-P by glucokinase
  - GCK Km \sim [glucose] in  blood
  - functions as a glucose sensor
- \uparrow glycolysis \to \uparrow ATP
- \uparrow ATP/ADP ratio detected by ATP/ADP-sensitive potassium channels (K_{ATP})
  - \to channel closure depolarization of the plasma membrane
  - \to voltage-sensitive Ca^{2+} channel opens
  - influx of extracellular Ca^{2+} stimulates insulin secretion by
    exocytosis from storage granules

** Insulin Secretion
- Other mechanisms regulate the release of insulin
  1) transcription factors, such as HNF1A and HNF4A

  2) metabolic factors which modulate the ATP production
     - leucine activation of glutamate dehydrogenase
     - short-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase 
     - monocarboxylate transporter 1
     - mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2
  3) receptors for various hormones and neuropeptides including:
     - somatostatin, insulin, GLP1,GIP, etc.

** Insulin Secretion

** Insulin Effects
- Activation of insulin receptors:
  - \uparrow glucose utilization
  - \downarrow lipid utilization
  - \uparrow cellular growth
  - translocation of GLUT4 to the PM
- Cerebral cells are poorly insulin-sensitive
  - highly dependent on circulating glucose
    - in hyperinsulinism, there is a significant risk of brain damage
      from neuroglucopenia.

** Congenital Hyperinsulinism
- CHI includes all genetic causes of hyperinsulinaemic
  hypoglycaemia due to a primary defect of the pancreatic
  \beta-cell
- CHI can present throughout childhood, most common in infancy
- Severe CHI is responsible for recurrent severe hypoglycaemia in neonates
  - delayed diagnosis or inappropriate medical management is responsible for brain damage in about 1/3
- Two main histopathological variants of CHI: diffuse and focal
- Three forms: transient, syndromic and isolated congenital HI

** Transient and Syndromic HI 
- Transient neonatal HI
  - can occur in newborns from diabetic mothers
  - small for gestational age
  - due to perinatal stress such as fetal distress or following birth asphyxia
  - Hypoglycaemia can be severe
    - usually resolves within a few days or months
- Syndromic HI
  - HI is part of a developmental syndrome.
  - Hypoglycaemia can be the initial manifestation of a number of
    different syndromes during the neonatal period
    - Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS)
    - CDGs (PMM2-CDG and PMMI-CDG)
    - Kabuki syndrome
    - Sotos syndrome

** Isolated Congenital HI
  - HI is inherited but occurs primarily as an isolated abnormality
  - Hypoglycaemia can reveal the disease in all ages
  - Hypoglycaemia occurs both in the fasting and the post-prandial states
  - Most neonates (86%) are resistant to treatment with diazoxide

** Metabolic Derangement
- functional defect of the pancreatic \beta-cells.
- inappropriate secretion of insulin \to hypoglycaemia
  - \downarrow hepatic glucose release from glycogen and gluconeogenesis
  - \uparrow glucose uptake in muscular and fatty tissues.
- CHI is heterogeneous, caused by various defects in regulation of insulin secretion.
  - channelopathies affecting the ATP channel (ABCC8 and KCNJ11 mutations)
  - metabolic defects:
    - enzymes deficiencies: glucokinase, glutamate dehydrogenase, or SCHAD
    - transporter deficiencies: MCT1 and the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2
  - transcription factors impairment, such as HNF1A and HNF4A.
  - exceptional cases, defect in the signalling pathway of the insulin
    receptor. 

** Genetics
- estimated incidence of severe CHI is 1 in 50,000 live births
  - in countries with substantial consanguinity it may be as high as 1 in 2,500
- The pattern of inheritance can be dominant or recessive
  - sometimes /de novo/
- In isolated CHI, the inheritance is:
  - autosomal recessive for ABCC8, KCNJ11 and HADH gene mutations
  - autosomal dominant or /de novo/ for GLUD1, GCK, UCP2,SLC16A1, HNF1A, HNF4A mutations
    - some cases for ABCC8 and KCNJ11 mutations.

** Diagnosis 
- Diagnosis of HI relies on 5 non-essential criteria:
  1. Fasting and/or post-prandial hypoglycaemia (<2.5-3 mmol/l).
  2. Inappropriate plasma insulin levels and c-peptide at the time of
     hypoglycaemia (potentially missed by a single sample because of
     the pulsatile secretion of insulin).
  3. Absent/low blood & urine ketones bodies and non-esterified fatty
     acids (NEFA). However, in some cases, ketones bodies and NEFA are
     not totally suppressed.
  4. \uparrow blood glucose \gt 1.7 mmol/l within 30â€“40 min after
     SC/IM or IV administration of 1 mg glucagon.
  5. The need for a high glucose infusion rate (GIR) to keep blood
     glucose above 3 mmol/l is characteristic of an insulin related
     hypoglycaemia

- Once HI is established molecular studies to identify a gene

* Disorders of Glucose Transport
** Glucose Transporters
- Glucose is hydrophilic \therefore cannot easily cross cell membrane
- Transporters exist in almost all cell types
- glucose transporter proteins can be divided into two groups:
  1. Sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLTs)
     - symporter systems, active transporters encoded by members of
       the SLC5 gene family
     - couple sugar transport to the electrochemical gradient of sodium
     - transport glucose \uparrow [gradient].
  2. Facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs)
     - uniporter systems, passive transporters encoded by members of the SLC2 gene family
     - transport glucose \downarrow [gradient].

** Congenital Defects of Glucose Transporters
- Five congenital defects of monosaccharide transporters
- Their clinical picture depends on tissue-specific expression and
  substrate specificity of the affected transporter.

  1. SGLT1 : Congenital Glucose/Galactose Malabsorption
  2. SGLT2 : Renal Glucosuria
  3. GLUT1 : Glucose Transporter-1 Deficiency
  4. GLUT2 : Fanconi-Bickel Syndrome
  5. GLUT10 : Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome

** Congenital Glucose/Galactose Malabsorption (SGLT1 Deficiency )
- SGLT1 is a high-affinity, low-capacity sodium-dependent transporter
  of the two monosaccharides, at the brush border of enterocytes.

- SGLT1 deficiency \to intestinal glucose-galactose malabsorption
- GGM is a rare autosomal recessive disorder.

- presents with severe osmotic diarrhoea and dehydration soon after a
  normal birth and pregnancy
  - patients develop severe hypertonic dehydration, often with fever
  - patients die from hypovolaemic shock.

- Treatement is a glucose and galactose free diet

** Renal Glucosuria (SGLT2 Deficiency)
- SGLT2 is the major co-transporter involved in glucose reabsorption in
  the kidney
- SGLT2 deficiency results in isolated renal glucosuria,
  - a harmless renal transport defect characterised by:
    - glucosuria
    - normal blood glucose concentrations
    - absence of any other signs of renal tubular dysfunction

** Glucose Transporter-1 Deficiency (GLUT1 Deficiency)
- GLUT1 is a membrane-spanning, glycosylated protein that facilitates
  glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier
  - low CSF glucose concentration (hypoglycorrhachia)

- clinical symptoms include: microcephaly, epileptic encephalopathies,
  paroxysmal movement disorders, tremor
- haemolytic anaemia has also been observed

** Glucose Transporter-1 Deficiency (GLUT1 Deficiency)
- both AD and AR inheritance have been described

- GLUT1D should be suspected in any child with a CSF glucose
  concentration \lt 2.5 mmol/L (range range 0.9-2.9 mmol/l)
  - normal \gt 3.3 mmol/L

- CSF to blood glucose ratio \lt 0.5 (range 0.19-0.52)
  - normal \gt 0.6
  - in the absence of hypoglycaemia or a CNS infection is diagnostic.
- ketogenic diet is used in treatment

** Fanconi-Bickel Syndrome (GLUT2 Deficiency )

- GLUT2 is a high-K_m monosaccharide carrier 
  - located in hepatocytes
  - basolateral membrane of cells in the proximal tubule
  - pancreatic \beta-cells

- Typically presents with a combination of increased hepatic
  glycogen storage, generalised renal tubular dysfunction, severe glucosuria.

- In FBS GLUT2 acts as a malfunctioning glucose sensor:
  - in the fasted state, [glucose] and [G-6-P] are inappropriately \uparrow in hepatocytes
  - stimulates glycogen synthesis, inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis
  - predisposes to hypoglycaemia and hepatic glycogen accumulation

- very rare autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in
  SLC2A2.

** Fanconi-Bickel Syndrome (GLUT2 Deficiency )

- Diagnosis suggested by the characteristic combination of an altered
  glucose homeostasis, hepatic glycogen accumulation, and the typical
  features of a Fanconi-type tubulopathy.

- Elevated biotinidase activity in serum has been found to be a useful
  screening test for hepatic glycogen storage disorders including FBS.

- Only symptomatic treatment is available.

** Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome (GLUT10 Deficiency)

- GLUT10 function not entirely clear:
  - localizes to mitochondria of smooth muscle and insulin-stimulated adipocytes
  - facilitates transport of dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), the
    oxidized form of vitamin C, into mitochondria

- GLUT10 deficiency is characterised by hyperelastic connective tissue
  and generalised tortuosity and elongation of all major arteries
  including the aorta

** Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome (GLUT10 Deficiency)
- presents with acute infarction owing to ischaemic stroke or an
  increased risk of thromboses.
- Aortic regurgitation and multiple pulmonary artery stenoses are
  typical intrathoracic manifestations.
- closely resembles a connective tissue disorder in presentation.

- rare, AR GLUT10 (SLC2A10)
- Echocardiography, angiography, and/or CT scan are important to demonstrate vascular changes.
- Diagnosis is based on molecular genetic methods
