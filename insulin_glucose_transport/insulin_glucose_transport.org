* Congenital Hyperinsulinemia
** Insulin Secretion
- glucose is transported into the pancreatic \beta-cell is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate by glucokinase
  - GCK Km \sim [glucose] in  blood
  - functions as a glucose sensor
- \uparrow glycolysis \to \uparrow ATP
- \uparrow ATP/ADP ratio detected by ATP/ADP-sensitive potassium channels (K_{ATP}),
  - \to channel closure depolarization of the plasma membrane.
  - volt-age-sensitive Ca^{2+}
  - influx of extracellular Ca^{2+} stimulates insulin secretion by
    exocytosis from storage granules.

** Insulin Secretion
- Other mechanisms regulate the release of insulin
  1) transcription factors, such as HNF1A and HNF4A

  2) metabolic factors which modulate the ATP production,
     - namely leucine (through the activation of the glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH,GLUD1)
     - short-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD, HADH)
     - monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1,SLC16A1),
     - mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2(UCP2)
  3) receptors for various hormones and neuropeptides including:
     - somatostatin, insulin, GLP1,GIP, etc.

** Insulin Effects
- Activation of insulin receptors:
- \uparrow glucose utilization
- \downarrow lipid utilization,
- cellular growth,
- translocates the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the PM
- Cerebral cells are poorly insulin-sensitive
  - highly dependent on circulating glucose
    - in hyperinsulinism, there is a significant risk of brain damage
      from neuroglucopenia.

** Congenital Hyperinsulinism
- CHI includes all genetic causes leading to hyperinsulinaemic
  hypoglycaemia that are due to a primary defect of the pancreatic
  \beta-cell
- CHI can present throughout childhood, most common in infancy.
- Severe CHI is responsible for recurrent severe hypoglycaemia in neonates
  - delayed diagnosis or inappropriate medical management is responsible for brain damage in about 1‚ÅÑ3,
- Two main histopathological variants of CHI: diffuse and focal

** Clinical Presentation in Neonates
1) Transient neonatal HI
   - can occur in newborns from diabetic mothers,
   - small for gestational age
   - due to perinatal stress such as fetal distress or following birth asphyxia.
   - Hypoglycaemia can be severe,
     - usually resolves within a few days or months.
2) Syndromic HI
   - HI is part of a developmental syndrome.
   - Hypoglycaemia can be the initial manifestation of a number of
     different syndromes during the neonatal period
     - Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS),
     - congenital disorder of glycosylation PMM2-CDG and PMMI-CDG,
     - Kabuki syndrome ,
     - Sotos syndrome
3) Isolated congenital HI
   - HI is inherited but occurs primarily as an isolated abnormality.
   - Hypoglycaemia can reveal the disease in all ages.
