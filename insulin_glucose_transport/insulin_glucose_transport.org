* Congenital Hyperinsulinemia
** Insulin Secretion
- glucose is transported into the pancreatic \beta-cell is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate by glucokinase
  - GCK Km \sim [glucose] in  blood
  - functions as a glucose sensor
- \uparrow glycolysis \to \uparrow ATP
- \uparrow ATP/ADP ratio detected by ATP/ADP-sensitive potassium channels (K_{ATP}),
  - \to channel closure depolarization of the plasma membrane.
  - volt-age-sensitive Ca^{2+}
  - influx of extracellular Ca^{2+} stimulates insulin secretion by
    exocytosis from storage granules.

** Insulin Secretion
- Other mechanisms regulate the release of insulin
  1) transcription factors, such as HNF1A and HNF4A

  2) metabolic factors which modulate the ATP production,
     - namely leucine (through the activation of the glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH,GLUD1)
     - short-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD, HADH)
     - monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1,SLC16A1),
     - mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2(UCP2)
  3) receptors for various hormones and neuropeptides including:
     - somatostatin, insulin, GLP1,GIP, etc.

** Insulin Effects
- Activation of insulin receptors:
- \uparrow glucose utilization
- \downarrow lipid utilization,
- cellular growth,
- translocates the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the PM
- Cerebral cells are poorly insulin-sensitive
  - highly dependent on circulating glucose
    - in hyperinsulinism, there is a significant risk of brain damage
      from neuroglucopenia.

** Congenital Hyperinsulinism
- CHI includes all genetic causes leading to hyperinsulinaemic
  hypoglycaemia that are due to a primary defect of the pancreatic
  \beta-cell
- CHI can present throughout childhood, most common in infancy.
- Severe CHI is responsible for recurrent severe hypoglycaemia in neonates
  - delayed diagnosis or inappropriate medical management is responsible for brain damage in about 1⁄3,
- Two main histopathological variants of CHI: diffuse and focal
- Three forms: transient, syndromic and isolated congenital HI

** Transient and Syndromic HI 
- Transient neonatal HI
  - can occur in newborns from diabetic mothers,
  - small for gestational age
  - due to perinatal stress such as fetal distress or following birth asphyxia.
  - Hypoglycaemia can be severe,
    - usually resolves within a few days or months.
- Syndromic HI
  - HI is part of a developmental syndrome.
  - Hypoglycaemia can be the initial manifestation of a number of
    different syndromes during the neonatal period
    - Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS),
    - congenital disorder of glycosylation PMM2-CDG and PMMI-CDG,
    - Kabuki syndrome ,
    - Sotos syndrome

**  Isolated congenital HI
  - HI is inherited but occurs primarily as an isolated abnormality.
  - Hypoglycaemia can reveal the disease in all ages.
  - Hypoglycaemia occurs both in the fasting and the post-prandial states,
  - Most neonates (86%) are resistant to treatment with diazoxide.

** Metabolic Derangement
- functional defect of the pancreatic \beta-cells.
- inappropriate secretion of insulin \to hypoglycaemia
  - \downarrow hepatic glucose release from glycogen and gluconeogenesis
  - \uparrow glucose uptake in muscular and fatty tissues.
- CHI is heterogeneous, caused by various defects in regulation of insulin secretion.

  - channelopathies affecting the ATP channel (ABCC8 and KCNJ11 mutations)

  - metabolic defects:
    - enzymes deficiencies: glucokinase, glutamate dehydrogenase, or SCHAD

    - transporter deficiencies: MCT1 (SLC16A1 mutations) and the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2)

  - transcription factors impairment, such as HNF1A and HNF4A.

  - exceptional cases, defect in the signalling pathway of the insulin
    receptor. 

** Genetics
- estimated incidence of severe CHI is 1 in 50,000 live births
  - in countries with substantial consanguinity it may be as high as 1 in 2,500
- The pattern of inheritance can be dominant or recessive,
  - and the genetic abnormality sometimes occurs de novo.
- In isolated CHI, the inheritance is:
  - autosomal recessive for ABCC8, KCNJ11 and HADH gene mutations
  - autosomal dominant or de novo for GLUD1, GCK, UCP2,SLC16A1, HNF1A, HNF4A mutations
    - some cases for ABCC8 and KCNJ11 mutations.

** Diagnosis 
- Diagnosis of HI relies on 5 non-essential criteria:
  1. Fasting and/or post-prandial hypoglycaemia (<2.5–3 mmol/l).
  2. Inappropriate plasma insulin levels and c-peptide at the time of
     hypoglycaemia (potentially missed by a single sample because of
     the pulsatile secretion of insulin).
  3. Absent/low blood & urine ketones bodies and non-esterified fatty
     acids (NEFA). However, in some cases, ketones bodies and NEFA are
     not totally suppressed.
  4. An increase in blood glucose greater than 1.7 mmol/l (30 mg/dl)
     within 30–40 minutes after SC/IM or IV administration of 1 mg
     glucagon.
  5. The need for a high glucose infusion rate (GIR) to keep blood
     glucose above 3 mmol/l is characteristic of an insulin related
     hypoglycaemia
* Disorders of Glucose Transport
** Glucose Transporters
- D-Glucose and other monosaccharides are hydrophilic an 
  cannot easily cross the lipophilic bilayer of the cell membrane.
- Transporters exist in almost all cell types
- glucose transporter proteins can be divided into two groups:
  1. Sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLTs)
     - symporter systems, active transporters encoded by members of
       the SLC5 gene family
     - couple sugar transport to the electrochemical gradient of sodium
     - transport glucose against its [gradient].
  2. Facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs)
     - uniporter systems, passive transporters encoded by members of the SLC2 gene family
     - transport monosaccharides down [gradient].

** Congenital Defects of Glucose Transporters
- five congenital defects of monosaccharide transporters
- Their clinical picture depends on tissue-specific expression and
  substrate specificity of the affected transporter.

- SGLT1, SGLT2
- GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT10

** Congenital Glucose/Galactose Malabsorption (SGLT1 Deficiency )
- SGLT1 is a high-affinity, low-capacity sodium-dependent transporter
  of the two monosaccharides, at the brush border of enterocytes.

- SGLT1 deficiency causes intestinal glucose-galactose malabsorption,
  a condition that presents with severe osmotic diarrhoea and
  dehydration soon after birth.

- GGM is a rare autosomal recessive disorder.

- present with bloating and profuse watery diarrhoea within days after
  a normal birth and a normal pregnancy
  - patients develop severe hypertonic dehydration, often with fever
  - patients die from hypovolaemic shock.

- Glucose and galactose free diet

** Renal Glucosuria (SGLT2 Deficiency)
- SGLT2 mutations result in isolated renal glucosuria, a harmless
  renal transport defect characterised by normal blood glucose
  concentrations and the absence of any other signs of renal tubular dysfunction.

** Glucose Transporter-1 Deficiency (GLUT1 Deficiency)
- clinical symptoms such as microcephaly,epileptic encephalopathies,
  paroxysmal movement disorders or different types of tremor,
  - caused by impaired glucose transport at the blood-brain barrier
  - haemolytic anaemia has also been observed

- GLUT1 is a membrane-spanning, glycosylated protein that facilitates
  glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier
  - low CSF glucose concentration (hypoglycorrhachia)

- both AD and AR inheritance have been described

- GLUT1D should be suspected in any child with a CSF glucose
  concentration \lt 2.5 mmol/l (range range 0.9-2.9 mmol/l)
- normal \gt 3.3 mmol/l

- CSF to blood glucose ratio is normally \gt 0.6
- <0.5 (range 0.19–0.52)
- absence of hypoglycaemia or a CNS infection is diagnostic.

- ketogenic diet


** Fanconi-Bickel Syndrome (GLUT2 Deficiency )

- Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (GLUT2), an important glucose and galactose
  carrier of hepatic, renal and pancreatic \beta-cells.
- Patients typically present with a combination of increased hepatic
  glycogen storage and generalised renal tubular dysfunction which
  includes severe glucosuria.

- GLUT2 is a high-K_m monosaccharide carrier that can transport both glucose and galactose
  - hepatocytes and at the basolateral membrane of reabsorbing cells
    of the proximal tubule
- In FBS hepatocytes, GLUT2 has the effect of a malfunctioning glucose
  sensor:
  - in the fasted state, the concentrations of glucose and
    glucose-6-phosphate within hepatocytes are inappropriately high in FBS.

  - This stimulates glycogen synthesis, inhibits gluconeogenesis and
    glycogenolysis, and ultimately predisposes to hypoglycaemia and
    hepatic glycogen accumulation [39]

- very rare autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations of GLUT2 (SLC2A2).

- suggested by the characteristic combination of an altered glucose homeostasis, hepatic glycogen accumulation, and the typical features of a Fanconi-type tubulopathy.

- Elevated biotinidase activity in serum has been found tobe a useful screening test for hepatic glycogen storage disorders including FBS.

- Only symptomatic treatment is available.

** Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome (GLUT10 Deficiency)

- GLUT10 deficiency is an entity characterised by hyperelastic
  connective tissue and generalised tortuosity and elongation of all
  major arteries including the aorta
- not related to impaired transport of glucose but of the structurally
  related dehydroascorbic acid at the mitochondrial membrane of smooth
  muscle cells and insulin-stimulated adipocytes.

- acute infarction owing to ischaemic stroke or an increased risk of
  thromboses.

- Aortic regurgitation and multiple pulmonary artery stenoses are
  typical intrathoracic manifestations.

- closely resembles a connective tissue disorder in presentation.

- rare, AR GLUT10 (SLC2A10)
- Echocardiography, angiography, and/or CT scan are important to demonstrate vascular changes.
- Diagnosis is based on molecular genetic methods
