\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgf70e648}
\begin{frame}[label={sec:org9ef5dd4}]{Krabbe Disease}
\begin{itemize}
\item A rapidly progressive CNS degenerative disease
\item Krabbe is both a leukodystrophy, affecting white matter of the central
and peripheral nervous systems, and an LSD

\item Incidence of 1:250,000 births
\item Cause by deficiency in galactosylceramidase
\item catabolism of galactosylceramide, a major lipid in myelin, kidney, and epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon.
\item results in accumulation of galactosylceramide in pathognomonic globoid cells
\begin{itemize}
\item Multinucleated microglia/macrophage seen in the white matter
\end{itemize}
\item galactosylspingosine (psychosine) in oligodenfrocytes and Schwann cells
\item spastic quadriplegia, blindness, deafness, peripheral neuropathy, pseudobulbar paralysis
\end{itemize}

\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item lysosomal trafficking of acid sphingomyelinase is mediated by sortilin and mannose 6-phosphate receptor.
\item MPR alone is sufficient to transport NPC2 to the endo/lysosomal compartment
\item Sorting of LMPs from Golgi/PM to endosomal system is mediated by
signals in the cytosolic domain
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:orge7a19b6}]{Genetics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Autosomal recessive
\item The GALC gene is situated at 14q31 and consists of 17 exons.
\item A recurrent 30 kb deletion has been described which extends from intron 10 to intron 17 of the GALC gene and in the homozygous state is associated with infantile onset disease.
\item The allele frequency of this deletion in Krabbe patients is reported to be approximately 50\% in Dutch patients and 35\% in non-Dutch European patients (Kleijer, WJ et al. (1997) J Inher Metab Dis 20:587-594).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Clinical Findings}
\label{sec:orgdc79a66}
\begin{frame}[label={sec:orgeedf985}]{Disease Spectrum}
\begin{itemize}
\item Krabbe disease comprises a spectrum ranging from infantile to late-onset.

\item Infantile-onset Krabbe disease is characterized by normal
development in the first few months followed by rapid severe
neurologic deterioration
\begin{itemize}
\item the average age of death is 24 months (range 8 months to 9 years).
\end{itemize}

\item later-onset disease manifests after 12 months and as late as the
seventh decade.

\item Historically 85\%-90\% of symptomatic individuals with Krabbe disease
diagnosed by enzyme activity alone have infantile-onset Krabbe
disease and 10\%-15\% have later-onset Krabbe disease,

\item NBS suggests that the proportion of individuals with later-onset
Krabbe disease is higher than previously thought.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:orgdf4b797}]{Clinical Findings}
\begin{block}{Age <12 months (infantile-onset Krabbe disease)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Excessive crying to extreme irritability
\item Feeding difficulties, gastroesophageal reflux disease
\item Spasticity of lower extremities and fist clenching, with axial hypotonia
\item Loss of acquired milestones (smiling, cooing, and head control)
\item Staring episodes
\item Peripheral neuropathy
\item the average age of death is 24 months (range 8 months to 9 years).
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Age >12 months (later-onset Krabbe disease)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Slow development of motor milestones or loss of milestones (e.g.,
sitting without support, walking), slurred speech
\item Spasticity of extremities with truncal hypotonia
\item Vision loss, esotropia
\item Seizures
\item Peripheral neuropathy
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{Diagnosis}
\label{sec:orgd48293c}
\begin{frame}[label={sec:org6f9ba05}]{Symptomatic presentation}
-The diagnosis of Krabbe disease, suspected in a
 symptomatic proband based on clinical findings (by age) and other
 supportive laboratory, neuroimaging, and electrophysiologic
 findings, is established by: 
\begin{itemize}
\item detection of deficient GALC enzyme activity in leukocytes.
\item Abnormal results require follow-up molecular genetic testing of GALC
\item elevated psychosine levels can also help establish the diagnosis.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:org3296d54}]{Screen positive}
\begin{itemize}
\item In an asymptomatic newborn with low GALC enzyme activity
on dried blood spot specimens on NBS
\item urgent time-critical measurement of:
\begin{itemize}
\item blood psychosine levels
\item GALC molecular genetic testing
\end{itemize}
\item is necessary to identify – before age 14 days – those
newborns with evidence of infantile-onset Krabbe disease who are
candidates for early treatment with hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\section{Laboratory Investigations}
\label{sec:orgce8aa8f}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:org393f6b1}]{CSF protein}
\begin{itemize}
\item protein in cerebrospinal fluid is elevated at the time of first symptom
\item with increased albumin and decrease in \(\beta\)-globulins
\item Leakage of the blood–brain barrier?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:org99497fb}]{galactosylceramidase assay}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:orgfbfd3d3}]{Psychosine}
\begin{itemize}
\item This test is used as a second-tier assay for infants who have abnormal newborn screens with reduced GALC (galactocerebrosidase) activity and to diagnose and monitor patients with Krabbe disease and Saposin A cofactor deficiency.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:org256326c}]{Newborn Screening}
\begin{block}{New York State}
\begin{itemize}
\item Almost 2 million infants were screened.
\item Five infants were diagnosed with early infantile Krabbe disease.
\item Three died, two from HSCT-related complications and one from untreated disease.
\item Two children who received HSCT have moderate to severe developmental delays.
\item Forty-six currently asymptomatic children are considered to be at
moderate or high risk for development of later-onset Krabbe disease.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[label={sec:orgb0d74c8}]{DBS Assay}
\begin{itemize}
\item The latest screening assay, developed in a collaboration between the University of Washington and PerkinElmer, tests for Gaucher’s, Krabbe’s, Niemann-Pick-A/B, Pompe’s, and Fabry’s diseases and MPS-I. The assay, UW/PE 6-plex, uses a single 3-mm DBS punch, which is incubated in a single-assay cocktail with all substrates and internal standards. After incubation and a liquid–liquid extraction, samples are analyzed by flow injection MS/MS. All internal standards are chemically identical to the corresponding enzymatically generated products but isotopically differentiated with deuteration. In this way, all enzymatic products are quantified via a chemically identical internal standard that experiences the exact same fate as the products (losses to downstream enzymes, adherence to surfaces, suppression in the electrospray ionization source of the mass spectrometer, and others).
\item With the advent of highly sensitive MS/MS, we had hypothesized that psychosine may be elevated in DBS samples of newborns with KD. Results from a small study showed this to be correct (Chuang et al., 2013). The original DBS specimens from the first four infantile KD cases identified through NBS had very elevated psychosine concentrations, whereas the psychosine levels of all of the asymptomatic high- and moderate-risk infants were only slightly elevated compared with DBS from infants with normal GALC activities.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[label={sec:orgb55e264}]{Treatment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Treatment of manifestations: Treatment of a child who is symptomatic
before age six months is supportive and focused on increasing the
quality of life and avoiding complications. For older individuals,
treatment with HSCT is individualized based on disease burden and
manifestations.
\item Prevention of primary manifestations: Consensus guidelines recommend
that asymptomatic newborns identified by either prenatal/neonatal
evaluation because of a positive family history of Krabbe disease or
an abnormal NBS result undergo additional testing to identify those
with infantile-onset Krabbe disease. Those with laboratory findings
consistent with infantile-onset Krabbe disease are candidates for
HSCT before age 30 days.
\item Surveillance: Monitor symptomatic individuals with Krabbe disease
for development of: hydrocephalus, swallowing difficulties and
chronic microaspiration, scoliosis, hip subluxation, and osteopenia,
decreased vision, and corneal ulcerations.
\end{itemize}
