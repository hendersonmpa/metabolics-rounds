** Pentose Phosphate Pathway
*** Oxidative Phase
- glucose 6-P \to NADPH + ribose 5-P
- Glucose 6-P dehydrogenase catalyses first step
- NADPH is for reducing reactions
  - NADPH/NADP^{+} \gt\gt\gt NADH/NAD^{+}
  - NADH is rapidly converted to NAD^{+} in the ETC
*** Non-oxidative Phase
- reversible rxns
- convert glycolytic intermediates to 5 carbon sugars
** Pentose Phosphate Pathway

- Ribose-5-P required for purine and pyrimidine synthesis
- NADPH required for detoxification and synthetic reaction
  - Detoxification
    - Reduction of oxidized glutathione
    - Cytochrome p450 monoxygenases
  - Synthetic reactions
    - FA synthesis
    - Cholesterol 
    - neurotransmitters
    - deoxynucleotide
    - superoxide

* The non-ischemic forearm exercise test
** Exercising Muscle
- Lactate, ammonia and purine compounds are generated by exercising muscle.
- Exercising muscle generates lactic acid from the anaerobic breakdown of glycogen
  - bc pyruvate generated by anaerobic glycolysis is not metabolized
    in the mitochondrial TCA cycle and is converted to lactate.
- Lactate enters the circulation and is converted back to pyruvate in the liver.
- Under anaerobic conditions it is essential that sufficient ATP is
  regenerated to provide energy so that contracting muscle can continue to work.
- Some ATP regeneration is provided by glycolytic metabolism of fuels,
  but this is relatively slow and most is achieved by the transfer of phosphate from phosphocreatine.

phosphocreatine + ADP \to creatine + ATP

- another transphosphorylation reaction catalysed by the
  myoadenylatekinase allows ATP to be regenerated with the formation
  of AMP

2ADP \to ATP + AMP
AMP \to IMP + NH_3

- IMP produced in this reaction is degraded to hypoxanthine
- alternatively recycled back to AMP in the purine nucleotide cycle.

This is converted to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and
ammonia by the enzyme myoadenylate de-
aminase (MADA) (see Equation 3).

Most ammonia produced by exercising
muscle is detoxied by the formation of
glutamine and ultimately excreted as urea,
owing to the activity of the urea cycle in liver.
Some ammonia is released by exercising skeletal
muscle directly into the circulation, from which
it is removed with a half-life of 20±30 min. 1 In
resting skeletal muscle ammonia is consumed
rather than produced and about 50% of arterial
ammonia can be taken up and metabolized by
skeletal muscle.
** Interpretation
- A normal lactate response is generally considered to be a 3-4x \uparrow plasma lactate 1 min after release of the cuff.
  - w gradual decrease to baseline
- Failure of lactate generation in the test is consistent impaired glucose metabolism in muscle.
  - McArdle’s disease (GSDV), GSDVII
- A consistently poor lactate response in the face of adequate effort therefore merits further investigation.
- determine maximum absolute change in both plasma lactate and ammonia, rather than the fold



- normal plasma ammonia response is a severalfold \uparrow 1 or 2 min after release of the cuff
  - and thereafter a gradual decline to baseline values.
- normal baseline plasma ammonia levels of 30\pm 65 mmol/L
- post-ischaemia peaks of 9\pm140 mmol/L
- any rise in plasma ammonia  i.e. above assay imprecision is likely to represent a normal response,
  - demonstrating that the subject has reached this threshold.
- Before a poor ammonia response can be considered pathological it is important to document adequate effort and to repeat the test to exclude day-to-day variation.
- Variations in ammonia response are larger than for lactate
- Maximal absolute ammonia response and maximal absolute lactate response to ischaemic exercise have been shown to be significantly correlated in normal subjects.

* Disorders
** Muscle Phosphofuctokinase
- GSD VII, AR

fructose-6-phosphate \to fructose-1,6-biphosphate
- can not use free or glycogen derive glucose as a fuel source
- accumulate glycogen
- Clinical Presentation
  - Like McArdle (GSD V)
  - muscle cramps, exercise intolerance, rhabdo, myoglobinuria
  - hemolytic anemia, hyperuricemia
  - usually childhood onset
- Diagnostic Tests
  - \uparrow bilirubin, \uparrow retic count distinguish PFKM from McArdle
  - FNIET = flat lactate, normal ammonia increase
