* Background

** Biotinidase Deficiency

- autosomal recessively inherited disorder of biotin recycling
  - associated with secondary alterations in amino acid, carbohydrate,
    and fatty acid metabolism.
- caused by absent or markedly deficient activity of biotinidase
  - cytosolic enzyme that liberates biotin from biocytin during the
    normal proteolytic turnover of holocarboxylases and other biotiny-
    lated proteins.

- Based on newborn screening outcome data from 2006, the incidence of
  profound biotinidase deficiency in the United States is estimated at
  1/80,000 births
- partial biotinidase deficiency between 1/31,000 and 1/40,000

** Biotinidase Deficiency

- Diagnosis of biotinidase deficiency is based on demonstrating
  deficient enzyme activity in serum or plasma

- Patients with profound biotinidase deficiency have less than 10% of
  mean normal serum activity

- Patients with the partial biotinidase deficiency variant have 10-30%
  of mean normal serum activity
  - are largely asymptomatic

- Confirmation of biotinidase deficiency by DNA analysis, by either
  allele-targeted methods or full-gene sequencing, may be useful.

** COMMENT Biotin Cycle

[[./figures/biot_cycle.png]]


** COMMENT Biotinidase

- Biotinidase is a monomeric enzyme encoded by a single gene (BTD) located on chromosome 3p25
  - comprises 543 amino acid residues, including 41 amino acids of a potential signal peptide.

- Three publicly available databases of biotinidase variants:
  - [[https://grenada.lumc.nl/LOVD2/shared1/home.php?select_db=BTD][Leiden Open Variation Database]]
  - [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/][ClinVar]]
  - [[http://www.arup.utah.edu/database/BTD/BTD_welcome.php][ARUP:Biotinidase Deficiency and BTD]]

- 204 biotinidase variants are consolidated in the ARUP database,
  - >150 categorized as pathogenic
  - 145 missense changes
  - Four common pathogenic variants cause profound biotinidase deficiency.

** Pathogenic Variants
- Among children ascertained because of clinical symptoms, the two
  most commonly reported variants are:

  - c.98_104delinsTCC in exon 2
    - seven-base deletion/three-base insertion
    - occurring in at least one allele in approximately 50% of individuals

  - p.Arg538Cys in exon 4
    - occurring at least once in 30% of children.

  - These variants result in complete absence of biotinidase protein. 

- Other relatively common variants discovered by newborn screening are:
  - p.Gln456His, associated with profound deficiency

  - p.Asp444His, a substitution that reduces enzymatic activity by about 50%.

  - The p.Asp444His variant in trans with a severe BTD pathogenic variant is associated with partial biotinidase deficiency,
  - p.Asp444His in cis with p.Ala171Thr (i.e., as the double mutant p.[(Ala171Thr); (Asp444His)]), results in a profound biotinidase deficiency allele.


** Partial & Profound Deficiency

*** Profound Deficiency
- Initially, most symptomatic children with biotinidase deficiency were found to have 3% of mean serum biotinidase activity of normal individuals.
- Three standard deviations above this mean, corresponding to 10% of mean normal activity, was taken as the threshold below which individuals were considered to have profound biotinidase deficiency.

*** Partial Deficiency
- With NBS for biotinidase deficiency babies were identified with about 25% of mean normal activity.
- Essentially all of these children had the p.Asp444His variant as one of their alleles
- This variant, together with a variant for profound deficiency on the other allele, results in 10–30% of mean normal biotinidase activity.
- These children are considered to have partial biotinidase deficiency.


** NBS for partial deficiency

- A retrospective study reviewing clinical histories of
  individuals with profound (22) or partial (120) biotinidase
  deficiency identified by newborn screening supports the long-term
  benefit of treatment and management of both populations. [fn:biot]

* Laboratory

** Enyzmatic Testing for Biotinidase Deficiency

- Fluorimetric method showed 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity. [fn:methods]
  - biotinyl-6-aminoquinoline
- Spectrophotometric method showed 90.5% sensitivity and 93.7% specificity.
  - biotin-4-amidobenzoic acid

** Prematurity and False Positives

| Disorder     | Total |    % | Prem |    % |
|--------------+-------+------+------+------|
| Galactosemia |   480 | 0.16 |   41 |  8.5 |
| Biotinidase  |   156 | 0.05 |   73 | 46.8 |

- Although approximately half of the infants with false-positive
  results for biotinidase deficiency were premature, less than 1% of
  the premature infants had false-positive results for this test.[fn:prem]

- Hourly temperature data from a weather station in London, ON was
  aggregated by week. The max temperature for each week was
  determined (figure [[fig:temp]])

** Filter Paper Print Lots in Use
- Filter paper print lots for all screen samples were determined for April to June 2018 (figure [[fig:form]])
