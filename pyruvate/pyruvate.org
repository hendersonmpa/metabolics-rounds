* Pyruvate Carboxylase Deficiency
** Pyruvate Carboxylase 

- PC is a biotinylated mitochondrial matrix enzyme.

- important role in:
  - gluconeogenesis
    - urea cycle indirectly
  - anaplerosis
    - \downarrow 2-ketoglutarate \to \downarrow glutamate
  - lipogenesis
    - oxaloacetate + acetyl-CoA \to citrate

** Clinical Presentation
- French phenotype (type B), most severe
  - acute illness 3-48h after birth
  - hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, vomiting
  - severe neurological dysfunction
  - death prior to 5 months
- North American phenotype (type A)
  - severe illness between 2 and 5 months of age
  - progressive hypotonia
  - acute vomiting, dehydration, tachypnoea, metabolic acidosis
  - severe intellectual disability
  - progressive with death in infancy
- Benign phenotype (type c)
  - rare
  - acute episodes of lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis
  - near normal cognitive and motor development
** Genetics
- Autosomal recessive with incidence of 1 in 250000
- PC is a homo-tetramer 
- PC protein and mRNA absent in 50% of French phenotype
- American and Benign phenotypes have cross-reacting material
- Mosaicism has been observed with prolonged survival

** Diagnostic Tests
- PC deficiency should be considered in any child presenting with lactic acidosis and neurological abnormalities
  - with hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, or ketosis

- \uparrow L/P with \downarrow BHB/acetoacetate  in severely affected patients
  - pathognomonic in neonates

- post-prandial ketosis, hypercitrullinemia, hyperammonemia, low glutamine

- CSF lactate, alanine and L/P are elevated, glutamine decreased

- PC activity in cultured skin fibroblasts
  - can not distinguish severity

** Treatment 

- Currently, no treatment.

* Phospoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase Deficiency
** Phospoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase Deficiency
- PEPCK has cytosolic and mitochondria isoforms
- Cytosolic PEPCK deficiency is secondary to hyperinsulinism
  - insulin represses expression of the cytosolic form
- Mitochondrial PEPCK deficiency has not been clearly demonstrated

* Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency
** Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency

- PDHC deficiency provokes conversion of pyruvate to lactate and alanine rather than acetly-CoA
- Glucose \to lactate, produces 1/10 ATP compared complete oxidation via TCA and ETC
- Impairs production of NADH but not oxidation
- NADH/NAD{^+} is normal, \therefore normal L/P
  - ETC deficiencies \to \uparrow L/P
- 
** Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex

- PDHC, KDHC and BCKD have similar structure and mechanism
- Composed of:
  - E1 \alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase
  - E2 dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase
  - E3 dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenases
- E1 is specific to each complex
  - Composed of E1\alpha and E1\beta
- In E1 is the rate limiting step in PDHC
  - regulated by phosphorylation

[[file:./figures/pdhc.png]]

** Clinical Presentation: PDHE1\alpha
- Majority of cases involve the X encoded to \alpha-subunit of the dehydrogenase (E1)
  - PDHE1\alpha deficiency
  - developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures and ataxia

- Common presentations in hemizygous males:
  1. neonatal lactic acidosis
     - most severe
  2. Leigh's encephalopathy
     - most common
     - present in first 5 years
  3. intermittent ataxia
     - rare
     - ataxia after carbohydrate rich meals \to Leigh's 

- Females with PDHE1\alpha, uniform presentation, variable severity
  - dismorphic features
  - moderate to severe intellectual disability
  - seizures common
  - severe neonatal lactic acidosis can be present

** Clinical Presentation: PDHE1\beta
- Only a few cases
- similar to PDHE1\alpha

** Genetics
- All components of PDHC are encoded by nuclear genes
- Autosomal except E1\alpha on Xp22.11
  - \therefor most PDHC deficiency is X-linked
- No null E1\alpha identified except in a mosaic state
  - suggests E1\alpha is essential

** Diagnostic Tests
- Lactate and pyruvate in blood and CSF
- CSF lactate is generally \uparrow compared to blood
- Urine organic acids
  - lactate, pyruvate, 
- plasma amino acids
  - alanine
- L/P ratio is usually normal
  - 

- Skin fibroblasts for PDHC

  - also lymphocytes, separated from EDTA <2days

- PDHE1\alpha genotype in girls is useful
** Treatment
- Early adoption of ketogenic diet may have a benefit
- Thiamine
- DCA is a pyruvate analog, inhibits E1 kinase, keeps E1 dephosphorylated (active)

** Pyruvate Transport Defect
- MPC1 mutations have been described in 5 patients
- mediates the proton symport of pyruvate across the IMM.
- \therefore metabolic derangement similar to PDHC deficiency

- No treatment

* Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase Deficiency
** Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase
- DLD (E3) is a flavoprotein common to all three mitochondrial
  \alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes
  - PDHC, KDHC, and BCKD
- Combined PDHC, TCA , BCAA defect
  - \uparrow lactate , pyruvate, 
  - alanine, glutamate, glutamine, BCAA
  - urinary lactic, pyruvic, 2-ketoglutaric, BC 2-hydroxy & 2-ketoacids

** Genetics and Diagnotic Testing
- DLD mutations AR
- 13 unrelated patients revealed 14 unique mutations

- Blood lactate, pyruvate
- plasma amino acids
- urinary organic acids
- Pattern of abnormalities not seen in all patients at all times.

** Next time
- TCA disorders
  - 2-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency
  - Succinate Dehydrogenase Deficiency
  - Fumarase Deficiency
