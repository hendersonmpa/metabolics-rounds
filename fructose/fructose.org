* Introduction
** Fructose Metabolism
- Fructose is mainly metabolised in the liver, renal cortex and small intestinal mucosa
- Pathway composed of fructokinase , aldolase B and triokinase .
- Aldolase B is also involved in the glycolytic-gluconeogenic pathway

** Disorders of Fructose Metabolism
- Three inborn errors are known in the pathway of fructose metabolism.
- Essential fructosuria is a harmless anomaly
  - characterised by the appearance of fructose in the urine after the intake of fructose-containing food.
- Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI)
  - fructose may provoke prompt gastrointestinal discomfort and hypoglycaemia upon ingestion
  - fructose may cause liver and kidney failure when taken persistently,
  - IV fructose can be lethal
- Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) deficiency
  - considered an inborn error of fructose metabolism although, it is a defect of gluconeogenesis.
  - hypoglycaemia and lactic acidosis (neonatally, or later during fasting or induced by fructose)
  - may be life-threatening

** Fructose Metabolism
pathway

* Essential Fructosuria
** Clinical Presentation
- Rare non-disease
- Detected a when test urine for reducing substances
- Deficiency in Fructokinase
** Metabolic Derangement
- 10-20% of ingested fructose is excreted in urine
- remainder is slowly metabolised in adipose tissue and muscle
** Genetics
- AR, 1:130,000 (underestimate?)
- KHK undergoes tissue specific alternative splicing
  - Two isoforms
  - ketohexokinase A, widely expressed, no clear role
  - ketohexokinase C, adult liver, kidney and small intestine
    - affected in essential fructosuria
  - Only 2 mutations found
** Diagnosis and Treatment
- \uparrow reducing substances in urine
- glucose oxidase negative
- fructosuria is dependant on fructose intake
- no treatent required
- prognosis is excellent

* Hereditary Fructose Intolerance
** Clinical Presentation
- perfectly healthy as long as they do not ingest food containing fructose, sucrose and/or sorbitol
- no metabolic derangement occurs during breast-feeding
- younger the child and the higher the dietary fructose load, the more severe the reaction
- first symptoms appear with the intake of fruits and vegetables or fructose containing formula
  - gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, restlessness,
    pallor, sweating, trembling, lethargy and, eventually, apathy,
    coma, jerks and convulsion
- laboratory tests indicate acute liver failure and generalised dysfunction of the renal proximal tubules.
- hypoglycaemia after fructose ingestion is short-lived and can be easily missed or masked by concomitant glucose intake
- food aversions form
- approximately half of all adults with HFI are free of caries
- affected subjects may remain undiagnosed and still have a normal life span.

** Metabolic Derangement
- FI is caused by deficiency of the second enzyme of the fructose pathway, aldolase B
  - splits fructose-1-phosphate (F-1-P) into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde
- The high activity of fructokinase after intake of fructose results in accumulation of F-1-P and trapping of phosphate.
- This has two major effects:
  1. inhibition of glucose production by blockage of gluconeogenesis
     (inhibition of aldolase A) and glycogenolysis (inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase A)
     - induces a rapid drop in blood glucose
  2. overutilization and diminished regeneration of ATP.
     - depletion of ATP results in an increased production of uric acid
     - a release of magnesium,
     - and a series of other disturbances,including impaired protein
       synthesis and ultrastructural lesions which are responsible for
       hepatic and renal dysfunction
- glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are not impaired in the fasted state in HFI patients due to activity of aldolase A

- same process happens in IV fructose to normal patients
- the use of fructose, sorbitol and invert sugar has been strongly discouraged for parenteral nutrition in general

** Genetics
- AR
- Three aldolase genes
- B is the major fructaldolase of liver, renal cortex, and small intestine
- A muscle
- C brain

** Diagnosis and Treatment
- nutritional history
- response to fructose withdrawl
- First tier molecular diagnosis
- Second tier (no mutations) Enzymatic
- Liver biopsy Aldo B activity
  - False low Aldo B secondary to liver damage

- remove fructose (sucrose and sorbitol) from diet


* Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphatase Deficiency
