* Peroxisomal \beta-oxidation Disorders
** Peroxisomal \beta-oxidation
- oxidation of a range of fatty acids including:
  1) very-long-chain fatty acids
     -  do not degrade fatty acids to completion
  2) pristanic acid
  3) bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid
  4) a range of eicosanoids

- Two acyl-CoA oxidases (ACOX1 & 2)
- Two bifunctional proteins (LBP & DBP)
- Two thiolases (ACAA1 & SCPx). 
- Single enzyme or transport protein defect result in abnormalities in some fatty acids.

** Peroxisomal \beta-oxidation Disorders
- Peroxisomal \beta-oxidation disorders can be subdivided into two groups:
  1) single peroxisomal enzyme or transport protein deficiencies
     - X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD)
  2) generalized peroxisomal beta-oxidation deficiencies.
     - Zellweger syndrome

* X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy
** Clinical Presentation
- 1/20,000 males and females
- childhood cerebral form is the most severe
  - neurological symptoms between 4-12 years
  - vegetative state and death
- Males may present with ADD or behavioural changes (due to
  visuospatial deficits \pm central hearing loss) as the first manifestations
- followed by severe visual and hearing impairment, quadriplegia and
  cerebellar ataxia.
- Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) affects 65% of adult X-ALD male patients (20–50 years)
  - up to 88% of heterozygous women (>40 years)
- Presentation is progressive spastic paraparesis and sensory ataxia.

** Metabolic Derangement
- ALDP deficiency a peroxisomal ABC transporter
- \to \uparrow VLCFA-CoA in cytosol
  - incorporation into a variety of lipids including:
  - cholesterol esters, phospholipids, and sphingolipids
- VLCFAs accumulate in virtually all tissues, including erythrocytes,
  white blood cells and plasma.

** Genetics
- X-ALD is caused by mutations in ABCD1
- X-linked

** Diagnostic Tests

- The single most important test for X-ALD is the analysis of VLCFAs,
  including C22:0, C24:0, and C26:0 in plasma after alkaline and acid
  hydrolysis to release the VLCFAs from all lipid species

- \uparrow concentration of C26:0
- \uparrow C26:0/C22:0 and C24:0/C22:0 ratios.
- In women, a normal plasma VLCFA level thus does not exclude the diagnosis adrenoleukodystrophy.
  - When a female is suspected to have adrenoleukodystrophy, mutation analysis is the most reliable method for the diagnosis.

- False-positive results, however, have been reported in patients on a
  ketogenic diet and especially in patients taking peanut butter

** Treatment
- A boy born with X-ALD has a 35% risk of developing cerebral ALD
  between the age of 4–12 years
- 100% risk of developing AMN between the age of 25-50 years.
- Cerebral X-ALD can be treated in boys and adult males
  - only at a very early stage of the disease,
  - when patients start to develop cerebral demyelination on brain MRI
    but have no or minimal neurologic symptoms.
- HCT can arrest the cerebral demyelination when the procedure is
  performed at a very early stage
* Zellweger Spectrum Disorders
** Clinical Presentation
- prototype of the ZSD:
 1) the typical cranial facial dysmorphia including:
    - high forehead, large interior fontanelle, hypoplastic
      supraorbital ridges, epicanthal folds, flat nasal bridge, and
      deformed ear lobes
 2) profound neurological abnormalities.

** Metabolic Derangement
- absence or marked deficiency of peroxisomes
  - assessed by catalase-staining in fibroblasts
  - using immunofluorescence microscopy analysis
- all peroxisomal functions are impaired.
- In classical ZS abnormalities include accumulation of VLCFAs,
  pristanic acid, di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid, and pipecolic
  acid and deficient plasmalogens in erythrocytes

** Genetics
- The genetic basis of the ZSD is markedly heterogeneous
  - biallelic mutations identified in:
  - PEX1, PEX2, PEX3, PEX5, PEX6, PEX10, PEX12, PEX13, PEX14, PEX16, PEX19, and PEX26
- All disorders are autosomal recessive

** Diagnostic Tests
- VLCFA analysis remains a good initial biochemical test
- erythrocyte plasmalogens
- pipecolic acid upon amino acid analysis
- DNA-panel containing all PEX genes or all genes coding for
  peroxisomal protein

** Treatment
- No treatment available
- supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is not beneficial
- Investigating cholic acid supplementation to reduce formation of the
  toxic bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid
* Peroxisomal \alpha-oxidation Disorders 
** Adult Refsum Disease
* Sjogren Larsson Syndrome
** Test

* Very Long Chain Fatty Acid Measurement
