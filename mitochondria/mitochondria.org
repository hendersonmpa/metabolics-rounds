* Introduction
** Mitochondria
- A double-membrane-bound organelle found in most eukaryotic organisms
- For instance, red blood cells have no mitochondria
- liver cells can have more than 2000.

- The organelle is composed of outer membrane, the intermembrane
  space, the inner membrane, and the cristae and matrix.

- The mitochondrion has its own independent genome that shows
  substantial similarity to bacterial genomes

- Mitochondrial proteins (proteins transcribed from mitochondrial DNA)
  vary depending on the tissue and the species. In humans, 615
  distinct types of protein have been identified from cardiac
  mitochondria,[16]

** Replication 

- Mitochondria divide by binary fission, similar to bacterial cell division

- mammalian mitochondria replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response
  to the energy needs of the cell,rather than in phase with the cell cycle.
  - When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and
    divide.
  - When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed
    or become inactive.

- mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter
  cells during the division of the cytoplasm.


** Alternative genetic code

- The mitochondria of many eukaryotes, including most plants, use the
  standard code.

#+CAPTION[mito code]: Exceptions to the standard genetic code in mitochondria
#+NAME: tab:code 
| Organism         | Codon    | Standard   | Mitochondria |
|------------------+----------+------------+--------------|
| Mammals          | AGA, AGG | Arginine   | Stop codon   |
| Invertebrates    | AGA, AGG | Arginine   | Serine       |
| Fungi            | CUA      | Leucine    | Threonine    |
| All of the above | AUA      | Isoleucine | Methionine   |
|                  | UGA      | Stop codon | Tryptophan   |

- the AUA, AUC, and AUU codons are all allowable start codons.
- Some of these differences should be regarded as pseudo-changes in
  the genetic code due to the phenomenon of RNA editing, which is
  common in mitochondria. 


** Maternal Inheritance

- the mitochondria and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually come from
  the egg only.

- sperm's mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo.

- Instead, paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo.

- The egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria, but it is these
  mitochondria that survive and divide to populate the cells of the
  adult organism.

** Heteroplasmy
- Heteroplasmy is the presence of more than one type of organellar
  genome (mitochondrial DNA or plastid DNA) within a cell or
  individual. It is an important factor in considering the severity of
  mitochondrial diseases. Because most eukaryotic cells contain many
  hundreds of mitochondria with hundreds of copies of mitochondrial
  DNA, it is common for mutations to affect only some mitochondria,
  leaving most unaffected.

- Although detrimental scenarios are well-studied, heteroplasmy can
  also be beneficial. For example, centenarians show a higher than
  average degree of heteroplasmy.[1]

- Microheteroplasmy is present in most individuals. This refers to
  hundreds of independent mutations in one organism, with each
  mutation found in about 1â€“2% of all mitochondrial genomes.[2]

** Muller's Ratchet

- Entities undergoing uniparental inheritance and with little to no
  recombination may be expected to be subject to Muller's ratchet
- the inexorable accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality
  is lost.
- mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process
  known as the mtDNA bottleneck. The bottleneck exploits stochastic
  processes in the cell to increase in the cell-to-cell variability in
  mutant load as an organism develops: a single egg cell with some
  proportion of mutant mtDNA thus produces an embryo where different
  cells have different mutant loads. Cell-level selection may then act
  to remove those cells with more mutant mtDNA, leading to a
  stabilisation or reduction in mutant load between generations. The
  mechanism underlying the bottleneck is debated,[135][136][137] with
  a recent mathematical and experimental metastudy providing evidence
  for a combination of random partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions
  and random turnover of mtDNA molecules within the cell.[138]
* Pyruvate and the Tricyclic Acid Cycle

* Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Oxidation

* Ketogenesis & Ketolysis

* Oxidative Phosphorylation
** Substrate-level phosphorylation
Unlike oxidative phosphorylation, oxidation and phosphorylation are
not coupled in the process of substrate-level phosphorylation, and
reactive intermediates are most often gained in the course of
oxidation processes in catabolism. Most ATP is generated by oxidative
phosphorylation in aerobic or anaerobic respiration while
substrate-level phosphorylation provides a quicker, less efficient
source of ATP, independent of external electron acceptors. This is the
case in human erythrocytes, which have no mitochondria, and in
oxygen-depleted muscle.

** Oxidative phosphorylation
 The complete breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen is called cellular respiration. The last steps of this process occur in mitochondria. The reduced molecules NADH and FADH2 are generated by the Krebs cycle, glycolysis, and pyruvate processing. These molecules pass electrons to an electron transport chain, which uses the energy released to create a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. ATP synthase then uses the energy stored in this gradient to make ATP. This process is called oxidative phosphorylation because it uses energy released by the oxidation of NADH and FADH2 to phospolyrize ADP into ATP.
