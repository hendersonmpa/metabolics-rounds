* Follow-up
** Follow-up

- Address a few outstanding questions from previous FAO talks

** Carnitine Transport Defect
- Organic cation/carnitine transporter(OCTN2) responsible for
  carnitine uptake across the plasma membrane
  - heart, muscle and kidney.

- *What about liver?*

  - Analysis of carnitine transport in different tissues suggests the
    presence of heterogeneous transporters.[fn:scaglia]
  - Liver and brain have a low-affinity (Km 2–10 uM), high-capacity transporter
  - Fibroblast, muscle, and heart cells have a high-affinity (Km 5–10 uM), low-capacity system.

characterization of the carnitine transporter defective in primary
carnitine deficiency. Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics,
364(1), 99–106.

** COMMENT Fatty Acid Transport
- Plasma Membrane Fatty Acid Binding Protein (FABPpm) and Fatty Acid
  Translocase (FAT) are involved in the uptake of fatty acids.
- Fatty Acid Transport Proteins
  - FATPs are integral transmembrane proteins that enhance the uptake of
    long chain and very long chain fatty acids into cells.
  - In humans, FATPs comprise a family of six highly homologous
    proteins, FATP1-FATP6,
  - found in all fatty acid utilizing tissues
  - acy-CoA synthase activity

** Models for Fatty Acid Transport Across Cell Membranes
[[./figures/FA_transport.jpg]]

\tiny
- CD35 = FAT
*** COMMENT
Schematic representation of the current view of fatty acid
transport across the cell membrane. Because the exact mechanism of
transmembrane translocation of fatty acids is still unknown, different
models have been suggested. (1) In view of their hydrophobic nature,
fatty acids could cross the membrane by simple diffusion. (2)
Alternatively, CD36 (88 kDa; also referred to as ‘fatty acid
translocase’), alone or together with the peripheral membrane protein
FABPpm (plasma membrane-associated fatty acid-binding protein; 43 kDa)
accepts fatty acids at the cell surface to increase their local
concentration and thus increase the number of fatty acid diffusion
events. (3) It is also possible that CD36 itself actively transports
fatty acids across the membrane. Once at the inner side of the
membrane fatty acids are bound by cytoplasmic FABP (FABPc) before
entering metabolic or signalling pathways. (4) Additionally, a
minority of fatty acids are thought to be transported by fatty acid
transport proteins and rapidly activated by plasma membrane acyl-CoA
synthetase (ACS1) to form acyl-CoA esters. (5) Very-long-chain fatty
acids (>C22) are preferentially transported by FATPs and by action of
their synthetase activity directly converted into very-long-chain
acyl-CoA esters (uptake by vectorial acylation).

** Oxidation of Medium-Chain Length Fatty Acids
- \uparrow solubility
- \to mito matrix via the monocarboxylate transporter
- *Are there any reports of disease causing MCT mutations?*

** Oxidation of Medium-Chain Length Fatty Acids

- "There is a general consensus that short-chain and medium-chain fatty
  acids (C4 to C12) diffuse freely across plasma and mitochondrial
  membranes" [fn:1]

- Butyrate is taken up by enterocytes, presumably by means of the
  monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1) and the sodium-coupled
  monocarboxylate transporter 1 (SMCT-1) [fn:2]

failure. N Engl J Med, 339(24), 1752–1757.

metabolism: the cellular perspective. Journal of Lipid Research,

** Monocarboxylate Transporter 1
- Out of 14 known mammalian MCTs, six isoforms have been functionally
  characterized to transport monocarboxylates and short chain fatty
  acids (MCT1-4), thyroid hormones (MCT8-10) and aromatic amino
  acids (MCT10)

- MCT1 mediates the movement of lactate and pyruvate across cell
  membranes.
  - erythrocytes, muscle, intestine, liver and kidney

| Phenotype                                         | Inheritance |
|---------------------------------------------------+-------------|
| Erythrocyte lactate transporter defect            | AD          |
| Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, familial, 7[fn:hi] | AD          |
| Monocarboxylate transporter 1 deficiency          | AR, AD      |

[fn:hi] promoter-activating mutations in patients with hyperinsulinemic
hypoglycemia induce SLC16A1 expression in beta cells, where this
gene is not usually transcribed, permitting pyruvate uptake and
pyruvate-stimulated insulin release despite ensuing hypoglycemia

** ACAD9 in VLCADD

- ACAD9 is responsible for production of C14:1 in VLCADD [fn:acad9]
- VLCAD^{-/-} cell lines accumulate C14:1
  - VLCAD^{-/-}/ACAD9^{-/-} cell lines accumulate C18:1

* Routine Biochemistry
** Routine Biochemistry 
- Glucose
- Ketones
- Lactate
- Ammonia
- Uric Acid
- Creatine Kinase (CK)
- Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) & Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platlets (HELLP)
  - Mothers who are heterozygous for LCHAD or MTP deficiency when
    carrying an affected fetus
** Fasting Hypoglycaemia  in FAODs
- Fasting hypoglycaemia is the classic metabolic disturbance in FAODs
  - primarily due to increased peripheral glucose consumption
 - The hypoglycaemia is hypoketotic.
  - Ketone bodies can be synthesised (medium-or short-chain FAODs or
    if there is high residual enzyme activity)
  - plasma concentrations are lower than expected for hypoglycaemia or
    the plasma free fatty acid concentrations.

** Randle Cycle [fn:randle]
- Fasted state:
  - Fatty Acids inhibit glucose oxidation at pyruvate dehydrogenase
    (PDH)
  - Long-chain acyl-CoA derivatives directly inhibit glucokinase
- Fed state:
  - Insulin inhibits lipolysis
  - Malonyl-CoA inhibits CPT1
    - \uparrow esterification of FA

** Inhibition of Glucose Utilization
[[./figures/glucose_oxidation_inhibition.png]]

*** COMMENT
Mechanism of inhibition of glucose utilization by fatty acid
oxidation. The extent of inhibition is graded and most severe at the
level of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and less severe at the level of
6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) and glucose uptake. PDH inhibition is
caused by acetyl-CoA and NADH accumulation resulting from fatty acid
oxidation, whereas PFK inhibition results from citrate accumulation
in the cytosol. The mechanism of inhibition of glucose uptake is not
clear. These effects reroute glucose toward glycogen synthesis and
pyruvate to anaplerosis and/or gluconeogenesis. See text for further
details. CYTO, cytosol; MITO, mitochondria; GLUT4, glucose transporter
4; HK, hexokinase; Glc-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; Fru-6-P, fructose
6-phosphate; CPT I, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; ␤-ox,
␤-oxidation.

** Inhibition of Fatty Acid Utilization

[[./figures/FAO_inhibition.png]]

*** COMMENT
Mechanism of inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by glucose. This
mechanism is mediated by malonyl-CoA, the concentration of which
depends on ACC activity and which inhibits the entry of long-chain
fatty acyl (LCFAcyl-CoA) moieties into mitochondria. This effect
reroutes fatty acids toward esterification. In extrahepatic tissues,
the effect of glucose is stimulated by insulin. See text for further
details. ACL, ATP-citrate lyase; FAS, fatty acid synthase.

** Lactic Acidemia in FAODs
- Lactic acidaemia is seen in long-chain FAODs (VLCAD, LCHAD and MTP deficiencies)
- Long-chain acyl-CoA esters have been found to inhibit a large
  variety of enzymes including the mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier.
# - The mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier catalyses the exchange of intra- and
#  extra-mitochondrial adenine nucleotides.
- /In vivo/ the ATP/ADP carrier catalyses the transport of ATP
  synthesized in the mitochondrion by the F_1 F_0-ATPase reaction to the
  extra-mitochondrial space in exchange for cytosolic ADP
  - \uparrow intra-mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio and \downarrow oxidation of
    NADH \to NAD^{+}    
- \uparrow ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD^{+} ratios will activate PDK
  - PDK inactivates PDH by phosphorylation.

  mitochondrial oxidation and reduction of NAD

** Hyperammonaemia in FAODs
- Hyperammonaemia occurs in some severe defects,
  - with normal or low glutamine concentrations;
  - decreased acetyl-CoA production reducing the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate [fn:haberle]

hyperammonemia. European Journal of Pediatrics, 170(1), 21–34.

** Hyperammonaemia in FAODs
[[./figures/2nd_ammonemia.png]]

\tiny
Influence of metabolic disorders on function of urea cycle leading to secondary hyperammonemia

** Moderate hyperuricaemia , elevated CK
- Seen in acute attacks 
  - The association suggests that the mechanism is a breakdown of
    cells, particularly muscle.
  - ATP depletion \to \downarrow Na/K-ATPase 
- Release of CK
- The uric acid excess is the product of nucleic acid and nucleotide catabolism. 

** AFLP/HELLP
- Mothers who are heterozygous for LCHAD or MTP deficiency when
  carrying an affected fetus
- A woman whose affected fetus has the Glu474Gln mutation on one or
  both alleles of the \alpha{}-subunit of the trifunctional protein is
  likely to have acute fatty liver of pregnancy or the HELLP syndrome [fn:odiab]
  - Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl metabolites produced by the fetus or
    placenta accumulate in the mother and are highly toxic to the liver
  - Exaggerated by the decreased metabolic utilization of fatty acids
    during pregnancy.
