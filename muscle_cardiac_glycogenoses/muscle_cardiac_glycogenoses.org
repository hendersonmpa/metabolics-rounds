* Introduction
** Muscle and Cardiac Glycogenoses

- at rest muscle predominately utilizes fatty acids.
  - uses blood glucose during sub-maximal exercise.
- Energy is supplied by glycogenolysis during intense exercise.
  - glycogenolysis supplies glucose for anaerobic glycolysis

** Metabolic Derangement
- Acid \alpha-glucosidase deficiency
- accumulation of glycogen within the lysosomes
- with different critical thresholds depending on the organ

** Genetics
- AR, AGL gene
- 200 mutations have been reported in GAA
  - ~ 75% of these being pathogenic mutations (www.pompecenter.nl)
- some genotype-phenotype correlation
  - severe mutations (such as del exon18) associated with the infantile form
  - ›leaky‹ mutations associated with the adult variant
- c.-32-13T>G is the most common mutation in adults and children with
  a slowly progressive course
  - approximately 80% of Caucasian patients.

** Clinical Presentation

*** Infantile
- first months of life with hypotonia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- also dysphagia, smooth muscle dysfunction, enlargement of the tongue
  and liver
- Most untreated infantile onset patients die from cardiopulmonary
  failure or aspiration pneumonia prior to one year of age 
*** Juvenile
- predominant skeletal muscle dysfunction
  - with motor and respiratory problems, rarely cardiac involvement.
  - Calf hypertrophy can be present, mimicking Duchenne muscular dystrophy in boys.
- Myopathy and respiratory insufficiency deteriorate gradually, and patients may become dependent on a ventilator or wheelchair.
*** Adult
- 3rd or 4th decade and affects the trunk and proximal limb muscles
  - mimicks inherited limb-girdle muscle dystrophies.
- Involvement of the diaphragm is frequent,
  - acute respiratory failure may be the initial symptom in some patients.
- the heart is generally not affected.
** Diagnostic Tests
- Acid \alpha-glucosidase enzyme assay
  - classic infantile ~ 1% residual activity
  - Children and Adults \le 30% activity
- Skin Fibroblasts are best tissue
  - Lower biochemical interferences (neutral \alpha-glucosidases)
- mutation analysis
** Treatment
- Recombinant acid \alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA)
  - CHO cells (alglucosidase alfa)
- Anti rhGAA IgG antibodies form
- 1/3 of ERT treated were ventilator free
- Better outcome if identified by NBS

* GSD Type III
** GSD Type III

** Metabolic Derangement
- Glycogen debrancher enzyme (GDE) deficiency
- has both glucosidase and transferase activity
  - cleaves \alpha-1,4 glucose linkages of the terminal glucose
  - then breaks \alpha-1,6 linkage to remove branch point
- accumulation of abnormal glycogen
- limited glucose release from glycogen
- gluconeogenesis functions normally
** Genetics
- AR, AGL gene
- mutations occur throughout AGL (GSD IIIa)
  - defect in liver and muscle
- two specific mutations in exon 3 (GSD IIIb)
  - liver only 
** Clinical Presentation
- Hepatic glycogenosis and (in most cases) also myopathic
- First year with poor growth, delayed motor milestones and abdominal
  distension
- Fasting hypoglycaemia 
  - Fasting tolerance is usually longer than in GSD I 
- Fasting ketosis is prominent.
- Gluconeogenesis is normal \therefore no fasting hyperlactataemia
- Moderate post-prandial \uparrow lactate
- Hyperlipdaemia
- \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow liver transaminases
- \uparrow CK in myopathic form 
** Diagnostic Tests
- DBE activity in leucocytes
- mutation analysis
** Treatment
- Aim is to maintain normoglycaemia, reduce the hyperlipidaemia and ketosis and
  ensure adequate growth.
- Regular meals and uncooked cornstarch
- Overnight continuous feeding is less commonly needed in GSD III than
  in GSD I
- Long term outcome for individuals with GSD III is generally good
  with survival into adulthood.

* GSD Type V
** GSD Type V

#+NAME: fig:hglyc
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.75\textwidth
[[file:./figures/gggmetab_muscle_cardiac.png]]

** Metabolic Derangement
- There are three isoforms of glycogen phosphorylase: brain/heart,
  liver and muscle, all encoded by different genes.
- GSD V is caused by deficient myophosphorylase activity.

** Genetics
- AR, PYGM
- \gt 100 known pathogenic mutations
- p.R50X mutation, most common in Caucasians
  - 81% of the alleles in British patients
  - 63% of alleles in US patients
- No genotype-phenotype correlations have been detected
- ACE polymorphism may be a phenotype modulator

** Clinical Presentation
- exercise intolerance with myalgia and stiffness in exercising muscles
  - relieved by rest.
- Onset of the disease occurs during childhood
  - diagnosis is frequently missed at an early age
  - affected children are often considered lazy.
- Myoglobinuria is the major complication, and occurs in about half of
  the patients.
- Creatine kinase (CK) can increase to more than 100,000–1,000,000
  UI/l during episodes of rhabdomyolysis
- Risk of acute renal failure

** Diagnostic Tests

- ischaemic forearm exercise test (IFET) was first used by McArdle to
  describe the absence of elevation of lactate during exercise.
  - *Should not be used*

- Non-ischemic FET has a sensitivity of 100% in McArdle’s disease
- Ammonia levels should be also assessed in parallel with lactate
  -  an abnormal increase in ammonia always observed in GSD V.
- PYGM gene sequencing

** Treatment
- no pharmacological treatment-
- exercise intolerance may be alleviated by:
  - aerobic conditioning programs
  - ingestion of oral sucrose
* LAMP 2 Deficiency (Danon Disease)
** LAMP2 Deficiency (Danon Disease)

[[file:./figures/gggmetab_muscle_cardiac.png]]

** LAMP2 Deficiency (Danon Disease)
- Danon disease is a rare X-linked disorder
- caused by a primary deficiency of lysosomal-associated membrane
  protein 2 (LAMP2).
- Presents after 1st decade
  - cardiomyopathy all cases
  - mild skeletal myopathy and developmental delay 70%
- muscle biopsy shows glycogen filled vacuoles
- consider cardiac transplantation

* AMPK Deficiency
** AMPK Deficiency

#+NAME: fig:hglyc
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.75\textwidth
[[file:./figures/gggmetab_muscle_cardiac.png]]

** AMPK Deficiency
- AMPK controls whole-body glucose homeostasis by regulating metabolism in multiple peripheral tissues, such as
  skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissues, and pancreatic \beta-cells
- activated \uparrow AMP/ATP ratio
- stimulates glucose uptake and lipid oxidation to produce energy
- inhibits energy-consuming processes including glucose and lipid production.

** Metabolic Derangement
- AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex comprising:
  - a catalytic subunit (α)
  - two regulatory subunits (β and γ).
- Three isoforms of the gamma subunits are known (γ1, γ2 and γ3) with different tissue
  expression

** Genetics
- The PRKAG2 gene coding for the \gamma-subunit of AMPK is located on chromosome 7q36.
- Mutations in the \gamma2-subunit of AMPK are transmitted as an
  autosomal dominant trait with full penetrance.

** Diagnosis & Treatment
- The differential diagnosis includes Pompe, Danon (LAMP2) and Fabry diseases.

- diagnosis, if clinically suspected, is based on ECG,
  echocardiography and molecular genetics.

- Treatment requires a pacemaker/defibrillator and heart transplant.
