* Disorders of Protein N-Glycosylation
** Introduction
- Most extracellular proteins, membrane proteins and several
  intracellular proteins (lysosomal enzymes), are glycoproteins.

- The glycans are defined by their linkage to the protein:
  - N-glycans are linked to the amide group of asparagine
  - O-glycans are linked to the hydroxyl group of serine or
    threonine.

- Congenital disorders of glycosylation are due to defects in the
  synthesis of glycans and in the attachment of glycans to proteins
  and lipids.
- Rapidly growing disease family (N-,O-,GPI) ~60 (listed on NORD)
  - 1% of HG involved in glycosylation

** Synthesis of N-glycans
1) Formation in the cytosol of nucleotide-linked sugars
   - mainly GDP-Man, UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcNAc
   - attachment of GlcNAc and Man units to dolichol phosphate
   - flipping into the ER
2) Stepwise assembly in the ER
   - addition of Man and Glc \to 14-unit oligosaccharide precuror:
     - dolichol pyrophosphate-N-acetyl-glucosamine_2-mannose_9-glucose_3
3) Transfer of this precursor onto the nascent protein
   - processing of the glycan in the Golgi apparatus
     - trimming and attachment of various sugar units

** CDG
- very broad spectrum of clinical manifestations
- considered in any unexplained clinical condition
  - particularly in multi-organ disease with neurological involvement
  - non-specific developmental disability is the only presenting sign
- Incidence 1:50,000 to 100,000 births

** CDG classification
- Each CDG type is defined by a specific enzyme defect and the mutation in its underlying gene
- Most CDG mutations are hypomorphic and allow some glycan synthesis
- Type 1: ER defects
- Type 2: Golgi defects
- ~1500+ cases worldwide
- ~300+ cases in the US
  - 70% PMM2-CDG

** Transferrin IEF
- serum transferrin IEF is still the screening method of choice
  - able to detect only a limited number of CDGs
  - N-glycosylation disorders associated with sialic acid deficiency

- Normal serum transferrin is mainly composed of tetrasialotransferrin
  and small amounts of mono-, di-, tri-, penta- and
  hex-asialotransferrins.

- Partial deficiency of sialic acid (-ve charge) causes a
  cathodal shift.

- Two main types of cathodal shift can be recognized:
  - Type 1 or 2 patterns

** Transferrin IEF

- A Type 1 pattern is characterized by an increase of both disialo- and
  asialotransferrin and a decrease of tetra-, penta-and
  hexasialotransferrins;

  - indicates an assembly disorder, and PMM2-CDG or MPI-CDG should be
    considered first.

- A Type 1 pattern is also seen in secondary glycosylation disorders
  such as chronic alcoholism, hereditary fructose intolerance and
  galactosaemia.

- In a Type 2 pattern there is also an increase of the tri- \pm
  monosialotransferrin bands.
  - indicates a disorder of processing

- A shift due to a transferrin protein variant has first to be excluded
  - IEF after neuraminidase treatment, study of another glycoprotein
    or, investigation of the parents.

** Additional Laboratory Investigations

- Protein-linked glycan analysis can be performed to identify the defective step
  - MALDI-TOF analysis of released N-linked oligosaccharides
- CDG gene panel analysis or WES.

- Capillary zone electrophoresis of total serum is a rapid screening
  test for CDG.
  - An abnormal result should be further investigated by serum
    transferrin IEF.

* PMM2-CDG (CDG-1a)

** Clinical Presenation
- CDG-Ia accounts for 70% CDGs
- The nervous system is affected in all patients
- most other organs are involved in a variable way
- neurological symptoms include:
  - alternating internal strabismus and other abnormal eye movements
  - axial hypotonia, psychomotor disability, ataxia and hyporeflexia.
- After infancy, symptoms include retinitis pigmentosa, stroke-like episodes, \pm epilepsy.
- 1st year variable feeding problems anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea \to failure to thrive.
- Other features are:
  - variable dysmorphism, which may include large ears, abnormal
    subcutaneous adipose tissue distribution, inverted nipples,
  - mild to moderate hepatomegaly, skeletal abnormalities and hypogonadism.
- Some infants develop a pericardial effusion \pm cardiomyopathy.
- At the other end of the clinical spectrum are patients with a very
  mild phenotype - no dysmorphic features, slight intellectual disability. 

** Metabolic Derangement
- PMM2-CDG is due to the deficiency of PMM2
  - principal isozyme of PMM
- Phosphomannomutase (PMM) 2 catalyses the second committed step in the synthesis of GDP-mannose
  - mannose-6-phosphate \to mannose-1-phosphate, occurs in the cytosol
- GDP-mannose is the donor of the mannose units used in the ER to
  assemble the dolichol-pyrophosphate oligosaccharide precursor
- defect \to hypoglycosylation
- deficiency and/or dysfunction of numerous glycoproteins, including:
  - serum proteins thyroxin-binding globulin, haptoglobin, clotting factor XI, antithrombin III, cholinesterase
  - lysosomal enzymes
  - membranous glycoproteins

** Genetics
- AR, PMM2
- \ge 107 mutations identified
- The most frequent mutation (c.422G>A) causes an R141H substitution
  - present in 75% of Caucasian patients
  - not compatible with life in the homozygous state.
  - frequency in Belgian as high as 1 in 50.
- The incidence of PMM2 deficiency is not known;
  - in Sweden it has been estimated at 1 in 40,000.

** Diagnostic Tests

- elevation of serum transaminase levels, hypoalbuminaemia, hypocholesterolaemia, and tubular proteinuria.
- Transferrin IEF
- To confirm the diagnosis, the activity of PMM should be measured in
  leukocytes or fibroblasts.
  - [2-H^{3}]mannose-6-phosphate
- PMM activity in fibroblasts can be normal

** Treatment
- No effective treatment is available.
- The promising finding that mannose is able to correct glycosylation
  in fibroblasts with PMM2 deficiency could not be substantiated in patients.
