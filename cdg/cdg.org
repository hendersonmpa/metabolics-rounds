* Disorders of Protein N-glycosylation

** Introduction
- Most extracellular proteins, such as serum proteins, most membrane proteins and several intracellular proteins (such as lysosomal enzymes), are glycoproteins.
- The glycans are defined by their linkage to the protein:
  - N-glycans are linked to the amide group of asparagine
  - O-glycans are linked to the hydroxyl group of serine or
    threonine.

- Congenital disorders of glycosylation are due to defects in the
  synthesis of glycans and in the attachment of glycans to proteins
  and lipids.
- Rapidly growing disease family ~ 
  - 1% of HG involved in glycosylation
** Synthesis of N-glycans
1) Formation in the cytosol of nucleotide-linked sugars, mainly
   GDP-Man, and also UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcNAc followed by attachment of
   GlcNAc and Man units to dolichol phosphate, and flipping of the
   nascent oligosaccharide structure into the ER.
2) Stepwise assembly in the ER, by addition of Man and Glc resulting
   in the 14-unit oligosaccharide precuror:
   - dolichol pyrophosphate-N-acetyl-glucosamine_2 -mannose_9 -glucose_3
3) Transfer of this precursor onto the nascent protein, followed by
   final processing of the glycan in the Golgi apparatus by trimming
   and attachment of various sugar units.

** CDG
- very broad spectrum of clinical manifestations.
- considered in any unexplained clinical condition
  - particularly in multi-organ disease with neurological involvement
  - non-specific developmental disability is the only presenting sign.
- Incidence 1:50,000 to 100,000 births.

** CDG classification
- Each CDG type is defined by a specific enzyme defect and the mutation in its underlying gene
- Most CDG mutations are hypomorphic and allow some glycan synthesis
- There are more than 100 types of CDGs
- Type 1: ER defects
- Type 2: Golgi defects
- 1500+ cases worldwide and approximately 300+ cases in the US
- New disorders continue to be identified including the 1st disorder of de-glycosylation


** Laboratory Investigations
- serum transferrin IEF is still the screening method of choice
  - able to detect only a limited number of CDG
  - N-glycosylation disorders associated with sialic acid deficiency

- partial deficiency of sialic acid in these forms of CDG causes one
  of two main types of cathodal shift.

- A type 1 pattern indicates an assembly disorder, and PMM2-CDG or MPI-CDG
  - (depending on the clinical presentation) should be considered first.

- If these are excluded, the next step could be dolichol-linked glycan
  analysis, or direct mutation analysis of a panel of genes known to
  be involved in CDG or whole exome sequencing (WES).

- A type 2 pattern indicates a disorder of processing.
  - Protein-linked glycan analysis should next be performed in an
    attempt to identify the defective step, or CDG gene panel analysis or WES.

* Phosphomannomutase 2 Deficiency (CDG-1a)

** Clinical Presenation
- CDG-Ia accounts for 70% CDGs
- The nervous system is affected in all patients
- most other organs are involved in a variable way.
- The neurological symptoms include:
  - alternating internal strabismus and other abnormal eye movements
  - axial hypotonia, psychomotor disability, ataxia and hyporeflexia.
- After infancy, symptoms include retinitis pigmentosa, stroke-like episodes, \pm epilepsy.
- As a rule there is no regression.
- 1st year variable feeding problems (anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea) \to failure to thrive.
- Other features are:
  - variable dysmorphism, which may include large,
    hypoplastic/dysplastic ears, abnormal subcutaneous adipose tissue
    distribution (fat pads, orange peel skin), inverted nipples,
  - mild to moderate hepatomegaly, skeletal abnormalities and hypogonadism.
- Some infants develop a pericardial effusion and/or cardiomyopathy.
- At the other end of the clinical spectrum are patients with a very
  mild phenotype (no dysmorphic features, slight intellectual
  disability). 

** Metabolic Derangment
- Phosphomannomutase (PMM) 2 catalyses the second committed step in the synthesis of GDP-mannose
  - mannose-6-phosphate \to mannose-1-phosphate, occurs in the cytosol
- PMM2-CDG is due to the deficiency of PMM2
  - principal isozyme of PMM
- GDP-mannose is the donor of the mannose units used in the ER to assemble the dolichol-pyrophosphate oligosaccharide precursor,
- defect \to hypoglycosylation
- deficiency and/or dysfunction of numerous glycoproteins, including:
  - serum proteins thyroxin-binding globulin, haptoglobin, clotting factor XI, antithrombin III, cholinesterase
  - lysosomal enzymes
  - membranous glycoproteins.


** Genetics
- PMM deficiency is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait caused by mutations of PMM2.
- At least 107 mutations identified
- The most frequent mutation (c.422G>A) causes an R141H substitution and is present in 75% of patients of Caucasian origin.
- This mutation is not compatible with life in the homozygous state.
- Its frequency in the Belgian population is as high as 1 in 50.
- The incidence of PMM2 deficiency is not known; in Sweden it has been estimated at 1 in 40,000.
