* Biochemistry
** Maple Syrup Urine Disease
- Only BCAA disorder detected by plasma amino acids.
  - \Uparrow \Uparrow leucine, also isoleucine and valine
    - Presence of alloisoleucine is pathognomonic
- Urine organic acids
  - \Uparrow \alpha{}-ketoisocaproate,
    \alpha{}-keto-\beta{}-methylvaleric and \alpha{}-ketoisovaleric
    - Also elevated in fasting state
** Rules

VICKERY, H. B. (1947). Rules for the nomenclature of the natural amino
acids and related substances. The Journal of Biological Chemistry,
169(2), 237–245.
** L-Alloisoleucine
- L-alloisoleucine is a branched chain amino acid and is a
  stereo-isomer of L-isoleucine.
- It is a common low [ ] constituent of human plasma.
- Produced as a byproduct of isoleucine transamination.
- L-alloisoleucine differs from L-isoleucine by having having
  different stereochemistry around its beta carbon.

** BCAA Catabolism
- First two steps are shared
- *BCAT*: reversible transammination
  - BCAAs escape first pass hepatic metabolism
    - \downarrow expression of BCAT in the liver
  - Metabolized in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue
- *BCKDC*: irreversible oxidative decarboxylation and thioesterification
  - CoA derivatives are committed to oxidative phosphorylation
  - BCKDC is the regulated step in BCAA metabolism
    - product inhibition
    - phosporylation
    - transcription

** Branched Chain \alpha{}-Ketoacid-Dehdrogenase Metabolic Machine
- 4-megadalton metabolic machine on the IMM
- organized around a 24-meric transacylase (E2b) cubic core
- encoded by six genetic loci
  - E1\alpha
  - E1\beta
  - E2
  - E3
  - BCKD kinase
  - BCKD phosphatase
- multiple copies of the above are attached to E2b via ionic interactions
- MSUD is classified into four molecular groups
  - IA, IB, II, and III
  - E1\alpha{}, E1\beta{}, E2, and E3

** Regulation of the BCKD Metabolic Machine
*** Feedback Inhibition
- product inhibition by branched chain acyl-CoAs
- \uparrow NADH:NAD^{+} ratio
*** Phosphorylation
- Inhibited by phosphorylation of E1\alpha Ser 293 
- \uparrow protein diet, adrenaline and glucogon dephosphorylate BCKD
- Phenylbutyrate prevents dephosphorylation 
*** Gene Expression
- subunit expression differentially regulated

*** COMMENT Note 
The macromolecular structure (4 x 106 daltons in size) is organized
about a cubic transacylase (E2b) core, to which a decarboxylase (E1b),
a dehydrogenase (E3) are attached through ionic interactions. E2b of
the BCKD complex contains 24 identical subunits with each polypeptide
made up of three folded domains: lipoyl (LD), E1b/E3-binding (BD), and
the E2b core domains that are linked by flexible regions.

E1 alpah2bbeta2 heterotetramers or E3 homodimers are
attached to BD. The BCKD kinase and BCKD phosphatase that are not
shown bind to LD. E1b catalyzes the ThDP-mediated oxidative
decarboxylation of branched-chain alpha-ketoacids. The
ThDP-hydroxyacylidene moiety is transferred to a reduced lipoyl
prosthetic group (in the box) on LD. The flexible LD carries
S-acyldihydrolipoamide to the active site in the E2 core to generate
acyl-CoA. The reduced lipoyl moiety on LD is oxidized by E3 on BD with
the concomitant reduction of NAD+. The sum of the above component
reactions is the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain
alpha-ketoacids (Reproduced from Ævarsson et al.,
Nat. Struct. Biol. 6: 785-792, 2000).

** Leucine

*** COMMENT
- CNS
  - compete for transport with other large neutral amino acids
    - LAT1 low Km
  - glutamate/GABA/glutamine cycle
    - \/ glutaminergic neurotransmitters
    - /\ ketoisocaproate -> mito disfunction
    - /\ mTOR -> decreased food intake
- Skeletal muscle
  - mTOR -> increased protein synthesis
  - /\ anabolism
  - /\ insulin secretion




* Diagnosis
** NSO Screening Logic

*** Screening
- Inital positive :: LEU/ALA \ge 0.85 AND LEU \ge 250
  - Repeat overnight
  - No weekend reporting
- Alert :: LEU/ALA \ge 1.25 AND LEU \ge 300
  - Repeat same day
  - Weekend reporting

*** Confirmation
- Screen Positive :: LEU/ALA \ge 1.0 AND LEU \ge 300

**  Newborn Screening ACT Sheet
*** YOU SHOULD TAKE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS IMMEDIATELY:

- Contact family to inform them of the newborn screening result and
  ascertain clinical status (poor feeding,vomiting, lethargy,
  tachypnea).
- Consult with pediatric metabolic specialist.
- Evaluate the newborn (poor feeding, lethargy, tachypnea, alternating
  hypertonia/hypotonia, seizures).
- If any sign is present or infant is ill, transport to hospital for
  further treatment in consultation with metabolic specialist.
- Initiate timely confirmatory/diagnostic testing and management, as
  recommended by specialist.
- Provide the family with basic information about MSUD and dietary
  management.
- Report findings to newborn screening program.

** Diagnostic Evaluation

[[./figures/leu_elevated.png]]

** Hydroxyprolinemia
- hydroxyproline is primarily derived from collagen turn-over
- hydroxyprolinemia is due to a defect in hydroxyproline dehydrogenase (HYDH)
- Hydroxyprolinemia is probably benign.

- hydroxyproline, leucine, isoleucine and alloisoleucine are isobaric
  - commonly termed as "Xle"
- share the same parent and product in FIA-MS/MS with butanol derivatization
  - 188 m/z \to 86 m/z , NL of 102 

** Clinical Considerations
- MSUD presents in the neonate with:
  - feeding intolerance
  - failure to thrive
  - vomiting
  - lethargy
  - maple syrup odor to urine and cerumen.
- If untreated, it will progress to:
  - irreversible mental retardation
  - hyperactivity
  - failure to thrive
  - seizures
  - coma
  - cerebral edema


* Treatment
** Acute Management in the Newborn
- Metabolic decompensation
  - hemodialysis and hemofiltration
  - high energy dietary treatment
  - leu reduced to \le 1 mmol/l in hours
- Recovery
  - BCAA-free formula
  - Monitoring plasma [aa] daily
    - Val, Ile

** Long-term management
- Similar principle to PKU
- BCAA free amino acid supplementation
- Prevent catabolism
- Serial monitoring of blood [BCAA]

- type II missense mutations that appear correlate with the milder
  thiamine-responsive form of MSUD


*** Liver Transplantation
- transplanted patient no longer require protein restriction
- \downarrow risk of metabolic decompensation
- candidate for domino transplantation

** Prognosis
- The age at diagnosis and the subsequent course are the most
  important determinants.
- Treatment initiated before 10 days of age gives the best results
- In early studies, only a few patients treated after 14 days of age
  achieved normal intellect.
- Chronic mild to moderate elevations of the BCAAs/BCKAs have been
  associated with dysmyelinating changes in brain,
- One study of 24 children over the first 6 years of life demonstrated
  that exposure to elevated plasma leucine levels has a negative
  impact on cognitive outcome, as measured by IQ testing
- Patients identified by the Massachusetts Newborn Screening Program
  - Carefully monitored and achieved good compliance
    - only a few mild episodes of metabolic decompensation.
  - Some are now college graduates in their 20s and 30s.
