* Introductions
** Introduction
- Copper is essential for cellular metabolism and toxic at [\Uparrow]
  - superoxide dismutase
  - > 90% of circulating copper is bound to ceruloplasmin
- 2 mg of copper absorbed each day from the intestine
- removed from portal circulation by hepatocytes
- excretion of copper by liver into bile is only method of removal
- Copper transporter CTR1 responsible for copper uptake in enterocytes and hepatocytes
- Intra-cellular transport done by two related ATPases
  - ATP7A : absorption : enterocytes : Menkes
  - ATP7B : excretion : hepatocytes : Wilson 

** Copper Metabolism

* Wilson Disease
** Clinical Presentation

- hepatic symptoms 8-20 years
- neurological symptoms 2nd-3rd decade
- Suspect in patients with:
  - liver disease w no obvious cause
  - movement disorder
- Occasionally isolated:
  - \uparrow transaminases
  - Kayser-Fleischer rings
  - hemolysis
- Diagnosis often made in siblings of patient

** Metabolic Derangement
- Defect in trans-Golgi protein ATP7B
  - required for excretion of copper and incorporation into ceruloplasmin 
- \downarrow t_{1/2} of ceruloplasmin with out bound copper
- rare patients with excretion defect and normal ceruloplasmin binding
- \downarrow excretion of copper into bile
- accumulation of copper in liver
  - secondary accumulation in brain, kidney and eyes

** Genetics
- AR, mutations in ATP7B, 1:30,000 may be higher, \sim 1/90 carriers
- ATP7b has 6 copper binding domains
- expressed predominantly in liver and kidney
- > 500 mutations in ATP7B described
  - most patients are compound heterozygotes
- loss of function mutations \to early hepatic presentation
- mutations with residual activity \to late neurological presentation

** Diagnostic tests
- \downarrow serum ceruloplasmin
- \downarrow serum copper
- \uparrow urine copper
- \uparrow liver copper
- \uparrow free copper
  - 1 mg ceruloplasmin contains 3.4 ug copper
- results should be taken together, there is a scoring system [fn:cpg]
- genetic analysis in family

- possible candidate for NBS

[fn:cpg] Clinical Practice Guidelines: Wilson's Disease, J Hepatol 56:671-685

** Treatment
- excellent prognosis if treated before severe damage
- penicillamine chelates copper and is excreted in urine
- oral zinc induces metallothionein synthesis
  - metallothionein binds copper preferentially to zinc
  - fecal excretion
- Trien (triethylenetetramine) is a chelator, used in patients who don't tolerate penicillamine
- combination therapy should be staggered - don't chelate treatment!


* Menkes Disease

** Clinical Presentation
- male infants 2-3 months
- neurodegeneration manifests as:
  - seizures, hypotonia, loss of milestones
- non-specific signs at birth:
  - prematurity, large cephalhaematomas, skin laxity, hypothermia
  - hair breaks easily, sandpaper feel

** Metabolic Derangement
- Defect in ATP7A 
- normal copper uptake, can not be exported from enterocytes into circulation
- insufficient copper for incorporation into ~20 cuproenzymes
  - lysloxidase : collagen cross-linking
  - tyrosinase : melanin formation
  - dopamine \beta-hydroxylase : catacholamin biosynthesis
  - peptidyl glycine monooxygenase : neuropeptide precursors
  - cytochrome c-oxidase : ETC

** Genetics 
- ATB7A, XR, 1:250,000 , 1/3 /de novo/ mutations
- expressed in all tissues except liver

If the reproductive fitness of a male affected with an X-linked
recessive disorder is low or nil, then in a population *one-third of*
*all affected X chromosomes will be removed from the gene pool every
generation*. If the incidence of the disease is constant, then
one-third of cases must be due to mutations arising de novo in a
family.

** The Haldane Hypothesis 
- Applies to X-linked recessive traits
  - A study of fertility rates in hemophillia

- In a large population of 2N (N \male{} and N \female)
- (1 - f)xN genes removed per generation
  - x = proportion of affected males in the polulation
  - f = effective fertility

- Each of N \female{} has 2X/cell, and each of N \male{} has 1X/cell
- The mean mutation rate per X-chromosome per generation is: [fn:haldane]

\[
u = 1/3(1 - f)x  
\]

** Diagnostic Tests
- \downarrow serum copper (< 11 umol/L)
- \downarrow serum ceruloplasmin (< 200 mg/L)
- not specific in 0-3 months of life
- plasma dopamine/norepinephrine
- copper retention in cultured fibroblasts

** Treatment

- often fatal < 3 years
  - infection or vascular complications
- Parenteral treatment should bypass ATP7A
  - disappointing results
  - near normal intellectual and motor development only possible with
    residual ATP7A activity
