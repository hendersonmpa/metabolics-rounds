* Introduction

** Niemann-Pick Disease
- There are three types of Niemann-Pick disease
  - Types A and B (ASMD or Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency)
    - Type A and B (ASMD or Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency) are also known as Type 1
  - Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC).
    - Type C (C1 & C2) is also known as Type 2

- The incidence of Niemann–Pick disease type C is estimated to be one in 150,000.
** Niemann-Pick A & B
- Incidence of Niemann-Pick A among Ashkenazi Jews ~ 1:40,000.
- Incidence of both Niemann–Pick A and B in all other populations ~ 1:250,000.
- Niemann-Pick Type A and B are caused by deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM).
  - sphingomyelinase is required to metabolize sphingomyelin.
  - results in progressive accumulation of sphingomyelin in systemic organs
    - brain accumulation in neuronal forms
  - There is growing evidence that NPA & NPB represent opposite ends of a continuum.
    - NPA generally have little or no ASM production (less than 1% of normal).
    - NPB have approximately 10% of normal level of ASM.

** Niemann-Pick C
- a fatal, neuro degenerative disease that affects 1 in 100,000
  - sometimes referred to as Childhood Alzheimer’s
  - extremely heterogeneous
  - biochemically, genetically and clinically distinct from Niemann–Pick A and B. 
- Accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, sphingomyelin, glycolipids in systemic organs
- GM2 and GM3 accumulate in brain
  - no increase in cholesterol
- NPC has two sub types NP-C1 (95%) and NP-C2 (5%)


** Niemann-Pick C

- LDL cholesterol enters cells via endocytosis at the LDL receptor.
- delivered to the late-stage endosomes and lysosomes
- hydrolyzed and released as free cholesterol.
- Unesterified cholesterol is transported to the plasma membrane and the ER for recycling.

- In NP-C, the LDL-cholesterol is trapped in lysosomes

** NPC1 & NPC2

#+CAPTION[]:
#+NAME: fig:

[[file:./figures/Niemann-Pick-C-Brown-and-Goldstein.png]]

\footnotesize
- NPC1 is a lysosomal membrane protein involved in transport in the endosomal-lysosomal system
- NPC2 acts in cooperation with the NPC1
- The disruption of transport results in accumulation of cholesterol and glycolipids in lysosomes.

** Lysosomal Protein Trafficking

#+CAPTION[traf]:Lysosomal protein trafficking receptors
#+NAME: fig:traf
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.65\textwidth
[[file:./figures/lysosome_trafficking.jpeg]]

\footnotesize
- lysosomal trafficking of acid sphingomyelinase is mediated by sortilin and mannose 6-phosphate receptor.
- MPR alone is sufficient to transport NPC2 to the endo/lysosomal compartment
- Sorting of LMPs from Golgi/PM to endosomal system is mediated by
  signals in the cytosolic domain

** Genetics

*** Niemann-Pick A & B
- Mutations in SMPD1
- Good phenotype-genotype correlation
*** Niemann-Pick C
- Autosomal recessive inheritance

* Clinical Findings

** Niemann-Pick A & B symptoms

*** Niemann-Pick A symptoms
- hepatosplenomegaly by age 3 months
- Failure to thrive
- Psychomotor regression at age 1
  - progressive loss of abilities – mental and physical
- Interstitial lung disease resulting in lung infections and lung failure
- Cherry-red spot identified with eye examination (100%)

*** Niemann-Pick B symptoms
- Symptoms outlined under NPA (but less severe)
- Thrombocytopenia 
- Short stature
- Cherry-red spot identified with eye examination (50%)

** Niemann-Pick C symptoms

- onset of the disease can happen at any age.
  - often school age children.
  - also been found in adults

* Laboratory Investigations
** Newborn Screening
- New York state is conducting a pilot newborn screening program for four lysosomal storage disorders.
- Pompe, Gaucher, Niemann-Pick A/B, Fabry, and MPS 1

- 4 years, 65,605 infants participated, representing an overall consent rate of 73%.
  - Sixty-nine infants were screen-positive.
  - Twenty-three were confirmed true positives, all of whom were predicted to have late-onset phenotypes.
  - Six of the 69 currently have undetermined disease status.

** Biomarkers

- Plasma biomarkers:
  - oxysterols cholestane-3\beta, 5\alpha, 6\beta-triol
  - 7-ketocholesterol
  - Chitotriosidase
- Bile acid:
  - 3\beta, 5\alpha, 6\beta-trihydroxy-cholanoyl-glycine

** Enzymology
*** Niemann-Pick A & B
- Deficient ASM activity in leukocytes or cultured cells.
  - use of native or radio-labelled substrate critical

*** Niemann-Pick C
- "filipin test"
  - culture fibroblasts in an LDL-enriched medium
  - pathognomonic free cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes
  - fluorescence microscopy after filipin staining
  - unequivocal results in ~ 85% of patients
