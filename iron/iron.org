* Introduction
** Introduction
- Iron is essential for the synthesis of haem and other
  metalloproteins.
- Among these metalloproteins, the iron sulfur protein cluster is very important
  - crucial role in mitochondrial metabolism
- \gt 20 mg of iron per day is required, only 1â€“2 mg from intestinal absorption,
  - the remainder is re-used
- Not actively secreted from the body
- \uparrow [iron] \to \uparrow [circulating free iron]
  - primarily taken up by the liver, the pancreas and the heart.
  - syndromes manifest with cirrhosis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy.

** Introduction
- Absorption of iron occurs primarily in the duodenum via the
  divalent-metal transporter(DMT1)
- The major recycling route for iron is removal from
  erythrocytic haem by haemoxygenase
  - in macrophages and enterocytes.
- Circulating free iron binds to to apo-transferrin forming holo-transferrin
- Transferrin can only bind iron in the ferric state 
- Ceruloplasmin catalyses the oxidization of Fe^{2+} into Fe^{3+}
- The transferrin receptor mediates the uptake of transferrin
- Iron is released from intracellular transferrin by a specific isoform of DMT1.
- In several cell types, including macrophages, iron can be stored
  bound to ferritin until needed.

** Iron Metabolism

*** COMMENT
Iron is imported into the enterocytes through the divalent metal
transporter, DMT1. Iron can also be acquired through direct uptake of
haem, from which it is released through haemoxygenase. Export of iron
into the circula- tion is accomplished by ferroportin. This process is
controlled through hepcidin, a protein synthesized in the
hepatocytes. Hepcidin transcription in turn is regulated by the
following proteins: HFE, hemojuvelin, matriptase-2 and transferrin
receptor-2. In the circula- tion, iron in the ferric state (Fe 2+ ) is
bound to apo-transferrin, forming holo-transferrin. Plasma iron in the
ferrous state is oxidized to the ferric state by ceruloplasmin to
allow binding. The transferrin receptor enables the uptake of
transferrin in target tissues, e.g.  the erythrocyte. Iron is
subsequently set free from transferrin by a specific DMT1 isoform. In
several cell types, such as the macro- phage, excess iron can be bound
to ferritin, and stored until needed 37

** Iron Sulfur Cluster Proteins

#+NAME: fig:fes
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.9\textwidth
[[file:./figures/fes.png]]


*** COMMENT
The respiratory chain enzyme complexes I, II, and III depend on
iron-sulphur (FeS) cluster cofactors, either [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S] or
[4Fe-4S]. The formation of FeS clusters uses sulphur from cysteine, Fe
2+ , NADPH, and ATP as substrates. A series of enzymatic steps are
involved and mutations in 12 proteins (in bold and underlined) have
been identified that cause human disease. Since FeS clusters are also
required for lipoate synthesis, elevated glycine due to glycine
cleavage deficiency can be indicative for FeS cluster defects. ISCU,
iron sulfur scaffold complex protein; FXN, frataxin; ACO, aconitase;
LIAS, lipoic acid synthetase; Ala, alanine; FDXR, ferredoxin
reductase; HSP, heat-shock protein; ISCA, Iron-sulfur cluster
assembly.


* Classic Hereditary Haemochromatosis

** Classic Hereditary Haemochromatosis: Clinical Presentation

- Also called Type 1 or HFE related haemochromatosis
- An autosomal recessive disorder
- Slow but progressive accumulation of iron in various organs
- Clinically apparent by the fourth or fifth decade of life
- Initial symptoms are nonspecific and include:
  - fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, weight loss and arthralgia.
- Increased awareness, and improved diagnostic testing
  - Classic symptoms of full-blown haemochromatosis are rarely seen
    - liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, diabetes, cardiomyopathy,
      hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, arthropathy and skin
      pigmentation


** Classic Hereditary Haemochromatosis: Metabolic Derangement
- Caused by a disturbance in iron homeostasis associated with hepcidin
  deficiency and systemic accumulation of iron.
- The exact role of HFE, is unclear at present.
- Most probably it is essential for sensing iron levels and thus
  indirectly for regulating hepcidin synthesis.

** Classic Hereditary Haemochromatosis

#+CAPTION[hfe]:
#+NAME: fig:hfe
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.9\textwidth
[[file:./figures/iron_met_HFE.png]]


** Classic Hereditary Haemochromatosis: Genetics
- As many as 0.5% of the Northern European population are homozygous
  for the C282Y mutation in HFE,

  - only 5% of male and <1% of female C282Y homozygotes eventually
    develop liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.

- Other mutations in HFE are also described, e.g. H63D,

  - compound heterozygosity for H63D and C282 is associated with iron overload

** Classic Hereditary Haemochromatosis:Diagnostic Tests
- transferrin saturation initially \uparrow
- followed by \uparrow serum ferritin
  - reflects increasing iron overload.
- Genetic testing of HFE should be performed when:
  - transferrin saturation is above 45%
  - serum ferritin is elevated:
    - >200 ng/ml in adult females
    - >300 ng/ml in adult males

** Classic Hereditary Haemochromatosis: Treatment and Prognosis

- At least half of all male and female C282Y homozygotes have normal
  serum ferritin levels and may never require therapy.
- Many have moderately elevated serum ferritin levels  (200-1000 ng/ml)
  - it is unclear at present whether all should have regular
    phlebotomies to reduce systemic iron load.
- serum ferritin levels exceeding 1000 ng/ml a phlebotomy regimen is clearly
  necessary.
  - In adults initially 500 ml blood is removed weekly or bi-weekly.
  - Phlebotomy frequency is usually reduced to once every 3-6 months
    when serum ferritin levels are below 50 ng/ml.


* Systemic Iron Overload Syndromes

** Juvenile Hereditary Haemochromatosis (Type 2)

- the most severe type of hereditary haemochromatosis
  - probably because hepcidin deficiency is more pronounced
- Patients present in the 2nd and 3rd decade
  - mostly w hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and cardiomyopathy due to
    iron overload.
- Type 2A is caused by mutations in the HJV gene encoding for hemojuvelin
  - necessary for proper hepcidin synthesis
- Type 2B from mutations in the HAMP gene encoding hepcidin.
- Serum ferritin is high and transferrin iron saturation elevated, as in classic
  HFE-related haemochromatosis.
- A final diagnosis is made by mutation analysis
- Phlebotomy is the treatment of choice and may prevent organ damage
  if initiated early.

[[file:./figures/iron_met_HJV.png]]



** TFR2-Related Hereditary Haemochromatosis (Type 3)

- Transferrin Receptor 2 (TFR2 gene) is important for sensing the
  intracellular iron status (e.g erythroid cells)
- Mutations result in iron overload phenotype which resembles classic, HFE-related haemochromatosis
  - patients are generally younger
- Low hepcidin levels along with elevated transferrin iron saturation,
  elevated ferritin and high liver iron content are present.
- Mutation analysis leads to the correct diagnosis in the absence of
  the classic haemochromatosis genotype.
- Phlebotomy is the treatment of choice.

#+NAME: fig:tfr

[[file:./figures/iron_met_TFR.png]]



** Ferroportin Related Hereditary Haemochromatosis (Type 4)

- Differs in several ways from the other three subtypes of haemochromatosis.
- AD inheritance and caused by mutations in SLC40A1, encoding ferroportin
- Expressed at the enterocyte and plasma membrane of macrophages.
- Loss of function mutations impair the export of iron from macrophages causing an iron
  deficiency in erythrocytic precursors.
- Patients present with a combination of mild microcytic anaemia with
  low transferrin saturation
  - iron overload predominantly in macrophages.
- Tolerance to phlebotomy is limited by the concurrent anaemia.
- In contrast, gain of function mutations cause resistance to feedback
  inhibition by hepcidin.
  - These patients present with a more classic hepatic iron overload
    haemochromatosis phenotype.

** Neonatal Haemochromatosis
- Once thought to be an AR inherited disorder, now recognized as acquired
  - Any disease state that chronically prevents the synthesis or
    activity of hepcidin will lead to haemochromatosis.
- Patients present in the first few weeks of life with severe liver
  failure.
- Caused by a maternal allo-immune reaction to the infant liver
  - starts /in utero/.
- Liver injury leads to a decrease in hepcidin
  - manifests as severe siderosis of both liver and extrahepatic organs.
- The diagnosis is made in any child with neonatal liver failure in
  combination with high serum ferritin and extrahepatic siderosis,
  - shown by MRI and/or oral mucosal biopsy
  - iron deposits in minor salivary glands in patients with NH.
- Therapy is by exchange transfusion in combination with IVIGs to remove/bind maternally derived IgG
- May a role for simultaneous antioxidant therapy
- The risk of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy from a mother who
  has given birth to an affected child is as high as 90%.
  - Recurrence risk reduced by IVIGs during pregnancy

* Iron Deficiency and Distribution Disorders

** Iron-Refractory Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IRIDA)
- This disease is caused by a deficiency of matriptase-2, encoded by TMPRSS6.
- If a mutation in both copies of this gene is present the normal cleavage of haemojuvelin is interrupted,
  - results in high hepcidin levels.
    - This will result in iron deficiency, low transferrin saturation
      (<10%) and microcytic anaemia at a young age [41].
- Oral iron supplementation is not effective, as high hepcidin
  levels will prevent iron release from the enterocytes
  - requires intravenous iron therapy

[[file:./figures/iron_met_IRDA.png]]

** Atransferrinaemia
- First described in 1961, very few cases of atransferrinaemia have thus far been described.
- AR disorder, mutations in TF,
- present with moderate to severe hypochromic microcytic anaemia and growth retardation along with signs of haemochromatosis.
- \downarrown serum transferrin
- \uparrow serum ferritin 
- Plasma infusions to increase the transferrin pool, represent an
  effective treatment

** Atransferrinaemia

#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.9\textwidth
[[file:./figures/iron_met_TR.png]]

** Hypochromic Microcytic Anaemia with Iron Overload Type 1

- Hypochromic microcytic anaemia with iron overload type 1 is caused
  by mutations in SLC11A2 , encoding DMT1.
- One of the isoforms of DMT1 is responsible for removing iron from
  absorbed transferrin in erythroid cells.
- Patients present at a young age with microcytic anaemia in combination with
  mild hepatic iron overload.
- Transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels are elevated.
- With erythropoietin (EPO) treatment regular transfusions can often be avoided


** Hypochromic Microcytic Anaemia with Iron Overload Type 1

#+CAPTION[dmt1]:
#+NAME: fig:dmt1
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.9\textwidth
[[file:./figures/iron_met_DMT.png]]


** Hypochromic Microcytic Anaemia with Iron Overload Type 2

- This subtype is caused by mutations in STEAP3.
- STEAP3, is an endosomal ferrireductase which facilitates the
  transferrin mediated uptake of iron.
- In the 3 siblings reported thus far, anaemia was present from early
  childhood,
- While patients became transfusion dependent several years
- Later, usually in late childhood.
- High ferritin levels, together with low transferrin and increased
  transferrin saturation were found.
- The degree of liver iron overload varied, all 3 had hypogonadism.

* COMMENT Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA)

** Aceruloplasminaemia 
- an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by accumulation of
  iron in the liver, islets of Langerhans and brain, in particular the
  basal ganglia and the retina
- Clinically the disease consists of adult-onset neurological disease (chorea, cerebellar ataxia, dystonia, par- kinsonism and psychiatric signs), retinal degeneration and diabetes mellitus.
- The major isoform of ceruloplasmin in the brain is necessary for iron import through its ferroxidase activity.
- More than 30 aceruloplasminaemia-causing mutations in the ceruloplasmin (CP) gene have been identified.
- The diagnosis is made by a combination of clinical symptoms, iron overload in liver and brain, and a nondetectable level of serum ceruloplasmin.
- In addition, serum iron is low (<45 Î¼g/dl) while there is a high serum ferritin concentration (850â€“ 4000 ng/ml).
- Desferrioxamine, a high-affinity iron chelator, reduces body iron stores and may therefore ameliorate diabetes as well as hepatic and neurological symptoms.

** Neuroferritinopathy
- autosomal dominant disease characterised by accumulation of deposits
  of iron and ferritin in the brain, most prominently in the basal
  ganglia, where it can even result in cavitation.
- Most patients present their first symptoms in early adulthood and over decades
  develop the full clinical picture, consisting of chorea, ataxia,
  rigidity and dystonia, as well as mixed complaints of cognitive
  dysfunction.
- Thus far, all mutations that have been described in FTL in patients
  with this disease affect the last part of the light chain of
  ferritin.
- Biochemical indicators of iron metabolism are normal, with the
  exception of serum ferritin, which is in the low to low-normal
  range. There is currently no effective treatment [33]

** Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration (PKAN)

- presents before the age of 6 years with dystonia, rigidity and choreaathetosis.
- Symptoms are slowly progressive, with involvement of the corticospinal tract and development of spasticity.
- Affected children lose the ability to walk within 10â€“15 years.
- atypical patients with slower progression and later onset.
- On MRI iron accumulation in the basal ganglia can be seen, showing
  up as areas of hypointensity in the globus pallidus, with bilateral
  areas of hyperintensity (â€ºeye of the tigerâ€¹ sign).
- AR disease is caused by mutations in PANK2 encoding pantothenate kinase 2
- a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A.
- A dysfunction of this enzyme will hinder the beta oxidation of fatty
  acids, giving oxidative stress and probably resulting in
  pathological changes at the sites that are most vulnerable,
  - the basal ganglia.
- Diagnosis is made by MRI and genetic testing in a child presenting with extrapyramidal symptoms.
- Treatment is symptomatic.

** Coenzyme A Synthetase Deficiency

- AR disease, few cases reported, causes a very similar clinical picture as observed in PKAN.
- caused by mutations in COASY, Coenzyme A synthetase,
- a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the last two steps in Coenzyme A synthesis

** Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy (INAD) 
- INAD is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in
  PLA2G6 encoding the calcium independent phospholipase enzyme
  iPLA2-VI.
- catalyses the hydrolysis of glycerophospholipids.
- Most patients with INAD present in infancy to early childhood with motor regression and hypotonia.
- MRI show iron deposition in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra

** Fatty Acid Hydroxylase Associated Neurodegeneration

- Mutations in FA2H may lead to iron accumulation in the brain.
- The encoded protein, fatty acid hydroxylase, is involved in the
  modification of the ceramide moiety of sphingolipids.
- Patients present in early childhood with gait difficulties, due to
  progressive spastic paraparesis and dysmetria.
- Cognitive decline is noted in their teens.
- Optic atrophy and xeroderma were also reported.
- On neuroimaging, profound pontocerebellar atrophy, confluent
  periventricular white matter abnormalities were found along with
  evidence of iron accumulation

** Mitochondrial Protein Associated Neurodegeneration

- Mutations in C19ORF12, encoding a mitochondrial protein which is
  involved in mitochondrial magnesium homeostasis appear to be a
  frequent cause of iron deposition in the basal ganglia.

- Psychiatric signs, optic atrophy, motor axonal neuropathy are common
  additional findings. Compared with PKAN, patients present at an
  older age and exhibit a more protracted course

** Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome

- Patients with this syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder caused
  by mutations in DCAF17, the product of which is thought to play a
  role in ubiquitinylation, present with hypo gonadism, diabetes
  mellitus, partial alopecia along with varying degrees of mental
  retardation.
- Brain MRI in the minority of patients who subsequently developed an
  extrapyramidal movement disorder revealed profound white matter
  abnormalities along with basal ganglia abnormalities consistent with
  iron deposition

** Static Encephalopathy of Childhood with Neurodegeneration in Adulthood (SENDA)

- X linked dominant disorder caused by de novo heterozygous or
  hemizygous mutations in WDR45.

- WDR45 encodes a protein with a 7-bladed propeller structure that
  offers a platform for reversible protein-protein and phospholipid interactions.

- It has an important role in autophagy

- Patients exhibit global developmental delay throughout childhood,
  and usually only develop extrapyramidal signs along with dementia in
  early adulthood.

- Iron accumulation in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra is
  noted in the later stages of the disease

** Kufor-Rabek Syndrome

- This autosomal recessive disorder characterized by juvenile onset
  Parkinson disease is caused by mutations in ATP13A2.

- Supranuclear gaze palsy, pyramidal signs and dementia are additional
  features. Evidence of basal ganglia iron deposition is present in
  some
